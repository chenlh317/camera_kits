## Executive Summary

**Based on 55,528 photos analyzed across 21 years, you are a wide-angle storyteller who consistently shoots 65-80% of photos at 20-35mm. However, if you want to cover the 70–200mm range with good quality, avoid a future 70–200mm investment, and retire the HX90, an all-in-one lens may now be the best fit.**

### Top Lens Recommendations (Choose Based on Your Priorities)

**Option 1: Sony SEL2070G (FE 20-70mm f/4 G)**
- Best for wide-angle-centric, quality-first, and lightweight travel
- Covers your sweet spot: 20-35mm is where you shoot most (65-80% of all travel photos)
- 90-95% coverage: Handles nearly all your documented shooting patterns with ONE lens
- Perfect ecosystem fit: Mobile (13mm ultra-wide) → SEL2070G (20-70mm) → 85mm prime (portraits) → HX90 (telephoto backup)

**Option 2: Sigma 20–200mm F3.5–6.3 DG or Tamron 25–200mm F/2.8–5.6 Di III VXD G2**
- Best for those who want to cover 70–200mm with good quality, avoid a future 70–200mm purchase, and retire the HX90
- One-lens solution: Covers wide to strong telephoto (20/25–200mm)
- Practical for non-photography-dedicated trips and mixed zoom usage
- Slightly more weight and some optical compromise, but maximum convenience

## Key Findings from Your Data

- **Your Shooting Evolution (2004-2025):**
  - Early years: 35-50mm normal lens era
  - Transition: 24mm wide-angle revolution (50-75% at 24mm)
  - Recent years: 23-27mm ultra-wide dominance (65-80% of shots)
- **Mobile Phone Integration:**
  - 75% shot at 23-29mm—mirrors your 24mm dedication on dedicated cameras
  - 28% of total photography—mobile is now a primary camera, not backup
- **What You Don't Need:**
  - 70-200mm telephoto zoom—85mm prime covers portraits, HX90 covers distant subjects
  - Ultra-wide zoom (10-18mm)—Mobile phone 13mm handles this superbly
  - 24-105mm—Dead zone at 50-70mm, doesn't go wide enough (24mm still limiting)

## Lens Recommendations


### Top Recommendations: Which Lens Should You Choose?

#### Option 1: Sony SEL2070G (FE 20-70mm f/4 G)
- 20mm wide end: Wider than your historical 24mm constraint
- Covers your sweet spot: 20-35mm is where you shoot 65-80% of the time
- 70mm telephoto end: Perfect handoff to your 85mm f/1.8 prime (no overlap)
- Data-backed coverage: 90-95% of your documented shooting patterns
- Ideal ecosystem integration: Mobile ultra-wide (13mm) → SEL2070G (20-70mm) → 85mm prime → HX90 (24-720mm)
- One lens on camera 90% of the time—minimal lens changes
- Lightweight f/4 aperture—travel-friendly without sacrificing too much low-light capability

#### Why SEL2070G Over Other Standard Zooms
- Wider start (20mm vs 24mm)—finally breaks your historical constraint
- No disadvantage at long end—both end at 70mm
- Similar weight/size—no penalty for extra width

#### Option 2: Sigma 20–200mm F3.5–6.3 DG or Tamron 25–200mm F/2.8–5.6 Di III VXD G2
- Massive range: Both cover wide to strong telephoto (20/25–200mm)
- One-lens solution: No need to carry or swap to a 70–200mm or HX90
- Retire HX90: Data shows >200mm is rarely used; 200mm covers nearly all your telephoto needs
- Portraits & details: 70–200mm range is ideal for portraits, candid moments, and compression
- Travel simplicity: One lens for almost every scenario
- Slightly heavier and some optical compromise, but maximum convenience

## Extended Range All-in-One Lenses: Sigma 20–200mm & Tamron 25–200mm

### Why Consider These Lenses?

You may want:
- Higher quality in the 70–200mm range for portraits, details, and compression
- To avoid investing in a separate 70–200mm lens later
- To retire the HX90 camera, since zooming beyond 200mm is rarely needed in your data

### Lenses Compared

**1. Sigma Contemporary 20–200mm F3.5–6.3 DG**
**2. Tamron 25–200mm F/2.8–5.6 Di III VXD G2**

#### Pros
- **Massive range:** Both cover wide to strong telephoto (20/25–200mm)
- **One-lens solution:** No need to carry or swap to a 70–200mm or HX90
- **Retire HX90:** Data shows >200mm is rarely used; 200mm covers nearly all your telephoto needs
- **Portraits & details:** 70–200mm range is ideal for portraits, candid moments, and compression
- **Travel simplicity:** One lens for almost every scenario

#### Cons
- **Size & weight:** Heavier and larger than SEL2070G (especially Sigma)
- **Aperture:** Variable and slower at the long end (f/5.6–6.3), less ideal for low light or subject isolation
- **Optical compromise:** All-in-one zooms are not as sharp as dedicated zooms or primes, especially at the extremes
- **Wide end:** Tamron starts at 25mm (not as wide as your historical 24mm comfort zone); Sigma starts at 20mm (matches your wide preference)

### Data-Driven Fit
- **Your data:** 65–80% of your shots are at 20–35mm, but you do use 70–200mm for portraits and details (10–15% on some trips, especially for people and architectural details)
- **HX90 usage:** Most of your telephoto shots are under 200mm; >200mm is rare and not critical for your style
- **Retiring HX90:** If you want to simplify and don’t need >200mm, these lenses can replace both your main zoom and HX90

### Comparison Table

| Lens | Range | Aperture | Weight | Wide End | Tele End | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------|----------|--------|----------|----------|------|------|
| Sigma 20–200mm | 20–200mm | f/3.5–6.3 | Heavier | 20mm | 200mm | One-lens, covers your wide/tele needs, retire HX90 | Slower at long end, size, typical all-in-one compromises |
| Tamron 25–200mm G2 | 25–200mm | f/2.8–5.6 | Moderate | 25mm | 200mm | Fast at wide end, one-lens, covers most needs | Not as wide as you prefer, slower at tele, some optical compromise |

### Recommendation

- **If you want to maximize simplicity and retire the HX90,** either lens is a strong option. Sigma is better for wide-angle (20mm), Tamron is faster at the wide end (f/2.8 at 25mm).
- **If you value wide-angle coverage above all,** Sigma is the better fit. If you want a brighter lens for indoor/portrait work and can accept 25mm as your widest, Tamron is worth considering.
- **If you want the best image quality and low-light performance,** the SEL2070G + 85mm prime is still superior, but you’ll need to keep the HX90 for rare telephoto needs.


**Bottom line:**
- These all-in-one lenses are a practical way to cover 95%+ of your needs in a single lens, especially if you want to avoid future investment in a 70–200mm and retire the HX90. Just be aware of the trade-offs in size, weight, and optical quality compared to a two-lens setup.

## Practicality of Carrying Two Lenses: 20–70mm + 70–200mm

### Real-World Considerations for Non-Photography-Dedicated Trips

While a two-lens setup (20–70mm + 70–200mm) theoretically covers nearly every scenario, the practicality depends on your travel style and actual usage patterns:

- **Mixed zoom usage:** Your data shows 65–80% of shots are at 20–35mm, with only 10–15% at 70–200mm (mainly for portraits, details, or occasional compression). The rest of the range is rarely used, and >200mm is almost never needed.
- **Non-dedicated travel:** On trips where photography is not the main purpose, carrying and swapping two large lenses can be cumbersome, especially when managing family, sightseeing, or spontaneous activities.
- **Weight and bulk:** A 70–200mm lens is typically large and heavy (often 700–900g), and combined with a 20–70mm, the total kit can exceed 1.5kg. This can be tiring over long days and may discourage you from bringing both lenses out each day.
- **Lens changes:** Swapping lenses in the field can be inconvenient, especially in crowded, dusty, or fast-moving environments. You may miss spontaneous moments or simply avoid changing lenses, defaulting to the more versatile zoom.
- **Psychological impact:** The more gear you carry, the more likely you are to leave some of it in the hotel or not use it at all, especially if your trip is focused on experience rather than photography.

### When a Two-Lens Kit Makes Sense
- If you have a specific day or location where you know you’ll want telephoto reach (e.g., wildlife, sports, distant landscapes), bringing the 70–200mm for that outing can be worthwhile.
- For most general travel, a single high-quality zoom (20–70mm or an all-in-one 20–200mm) is more practical and aligns with your historical usage.

### Data-Driven Advice
- **For your style:** Unless you are planning a dedicated photo shoot or expect to use the 70–200mm range extensively, it’s usually more enjoyable and efficient to travel light with a single lens that covers your main needs. Your data and experience suggest that the convenience of a one-lens solution outweighs the small percentage of shots you might miss at the long end.

**Bottom line:** Carrying both a 20–70mm and a 70–200mm is possible, but for non-photography-dedicated trips with mixed zoom usage, it is often impractical. Consider your comfort, travel plans, and how much you value convenience versus maximum coverage.

## Alternative Options

- **24-70mm f/2.8 or f/4:** 24mm matches your historical workhorse focal length, covers 85-92% of all your shots, but doesn't go as wide as your mobile (13mm/23mm).
- **16-35mm f/4:** Wider than anything you've had (16mm vs 24mm), covers your core 65-80% wide-angle range, but creates a 35-85mm gap.
- **18-50mm f/2.8:** Covers 23-50mm sweet spot (75-90% of your shots), but doesn't reach 70mm for portrait overlap.
- **Mobile + 85mm Prime + HX90:** Already own 2 of 3 devices, covers all needs but with quality trade-offs.
