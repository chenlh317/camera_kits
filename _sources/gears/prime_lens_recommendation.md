### 🏛️ Museum Photography Analysis (NEW)

From your **Musée du Louvre** data (668 photos across 2015-2018):

| Year        | 24mm Usage      | 24-35mm Cumulative | Key Pattern                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **2015**    | 53% at 24mm     | 65% at 24-35mm     | Wide + telephoto for details |
| **2016**    | 79% at 24mm     | 87% at 24-41mm     | Strong wide dominance        |
| **2018**    | 90% at 24mm     | 96% at 24-37mm     | Near-exclusive wide-angle    |
| **Overall** | **75% at 24mm** | **85% at 24-41mm** | Wide-angle essential         |

**Museum Photography Insights:**

1. **Wide-angle dominance (75% at 24mm):**
   - Grand gallery interiors require wide coverage
   - Capturing architectural context with artworks
   - Working in crowded spaces with limited movement

2. **Telephoto for details (5% at 50-100mm):**
   - Artwork details when barriers prevent close approach
   - Isolating specific elements from large paintings
   - 85mm perfect for sculpture details and small works

3. **35mm is ideal for museums:**
   - Wider than 50mm for room context
   - Less distortion than 24mm for artwork documentation
   - f/1.8 handles dim gallery lighting without flash
   - Note: If you prefer the dedicated camera for expansive interiors
     (your Louvre data is ~75% at 24mm), a 24mm prime is a solid alternative.
     Otherwise, rely on smartphone ultra-wide to complement 35mm for room coverage.

**Museum-Specific Requirements:**
- ✅ **No flash allowed** → f/1.8 aperture essential
- ✅ **Silent shooting** → Sony's electronic shutter + quiet AF
- ✅ **Low light** → A7C II ISO 3200-6400 + f/1.8 = hand-holdable
- ✅ **Compact size** → Museums often restrict large equipment

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Excellent for events, travel, environmental portraiture
- ⚠️ **Focus breathing** — field of view changes when focusing (less ideal for video)
- ⚠️ Some longitudinal CA at wide apertures
- ⚠️ AF speed and sharpness are very good, but Sony’s native lens typically focuses faster

**Verdict:** If you value build quality and aperture ring,
the Sigma is excellent. The Sony is lighter, sharper, and has native AF advantage.

### 🥉 **Ultra-Budget: Viltrox AF 35mm f/1.8 FE**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~340g        |
| **Filter**      | 55mm         |
| **Close Focus** | ~0.40m       |
| **Price**       | ~$350-400    |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Half the price** of Sony — significant savings
- ✅ **Fast f/1.8** — Same light gathering as Sony
- ✅ **Punchy rendering** — pleasing micro-contrast
- ⚠️ **Long minimum focus (~40cm)** — longer than Sony (22cm) or Sigma (27cm)
- ⚠️ **AF limitations** — AF-C tracking less reliable than native Sony

- Save ~$300-450 vs Sony pair
- Sigma's premium metal build
- Viltrox’s optics and price are attractive

**Cons:**
- Both lenses f/2 or f/1.8 — slight light loss vs Sony pair
- Third-party AF not quite Sony-level; heavier overall weight

---

### Strategy C: Mixed (Best Value + Performance) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Lenses:**
| Lens                  | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sony FE 35mm f/1.8    | Night city, indoor events | $750-850 | 280g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/1.8 II | Kid portraits             | $350-400 | ~500g  |

**Total:** ~$1,100-1,250 | ~780g both primes

**Rationale:**
- 35mm used more often → invest in Sony for best AF speed
- 85mm for portrait sessions → Viltrox II offers strong optics at low cost (AF slower)
- **Best balance of price and performance**

### Your Use Cases: How f/1.8 Helps

**Indoor Gala Night Scenario:**
| Setting         | f/4 Zoom          | f/1.8 Prime      | Advantage       |

| Candlelit table | ISO 25600, 1/30s  | ISO 6400, 1/30s  | Usable vs noisy |

**Night City Sightseeing:**
| Scenario     | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Blue hour    | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | Maximum quality |
| Night street | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | 2 stops cleaner |
| Indoor cafe  | ISO 3200        | ISO 800         | Minimal noise   |

**🏛️ Museum Gallery (NEW):**
| Scenario                  | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Bright gallery            | ISO 1600        | ISO 400         | Maximum detail  |
| Dim Old Masters room      | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | 2 stops cleaner |
| Sculpture hall            | ISO 3200        | ISO 800         | Clean shadows   |
| Louvre Pyramid (interior) | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | Best quality    |

**Museum-Specific Advantages of f/1.8:**
- **No flash required** - Most museums prohibit flash photography
- **Silent shooting** - A7C II electronic shutter + quiet prime AF
- **Compact gear** - Museums may restrict professional-looking equipment
- **Natural colors** - Avoid flash washing out artwork colors

**A7C II + f/1.8 = No-Flash Photography**

The A7C II has excellent high-ISO performance up to ISO 6400 with acceptable noise. Combined with:
- f/1.8 aperture (4× light vs f/4)
- 5-axis IBIS rated up to ~7 stops (CIPA, lens/body dependent)
- Fast eye-AF (works in low EV)

You can shoot almost any indoor event or museum without flash, preserving natural ambiance.

## 📐 Why NOT Other Focal Lengths

### ❌ 20mm Prime
- **Your mobile (Samsung S25):** Already shoots 13mm ultra-wide excellently
- **Usage data:** Only 6-8% of shots at ultra-wide
- **Indoor events:** Too wide, distorts faces at edges
- **Verdict:** Mobile covers this; don't duplicate

### ❌ 24mm Prime
- **Close to mobile:** S25 shoots ~23mm — nearly identical field of view
- **If you need wider than mobile:** consider 20mm
- **Indoor limitation:** Similar issues as 20mm for portraits
- **Verdict:** Often redundant with your smartphone for interiors;
  still worthwhile if you prefer higher IQ on the dedicated camera

### ❌ 40mm Prime
- **"Tweener" focal length:** Neither wide nor portrait
- **Limited options:** Fewer choices, often slower (f/2.5)
- **Your data:** No strong clustering at 40mm in archives
- **Verdict:** 35mm more versatile

### ❌ 50mm Prime
- **Too close to 35mm:** Only 15mm difference
- **Not enough for portraits:** 50mm less flattering than 85mm for faces
- **Your data:** 50mm usage lower than 35mm and 85mm peaks
- **Verdict:** Creates awkward coverage with 35mm or 85mm
