### 🎯 Top Gear Recommendations

**Four Top Lens Strategies (Plus One Alternative - Choose Based on Your Priorities):**

---

**🥇 Option 1A: Sony SEL2070G (FE 20-70mm f/4 G)** - ~\$1,100 | **Best Quality in Primary Zone**

**Why this lens:**
- **Covers your sweet spot:** 20-35mm is where you shoot most (65-80% of all travel photos)
- **Wider than ever before:** 20mm breaks your historical 24mm constraint
- **G-series optical excellence:** Superior sharpness in your 85-90% usage zone (20–70mm)
- **Perfect ecosystem fit:** Mobile (13mm ultra-wide) → SEL2070G (20–70mm)
  → 85mm prime (portraits) → HX90 (telephoto backup)

For comparisons vs 24–70 f/4, 16–35 f/4, and 24–70 f/2.8,
see [Why SEL2070G Over Alternatives](why-sel2070g-over-alternatives).

**Choose this if:** Optical quality in 20–70mm is paramount;
you're okay keeping HX90 as telephoto backup.

> 💡 **Note:** Options 1A and 1C have the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~\$1,100).
> The only difference is your future plan: 1A keeps HX90 long-term,
> while 1C plans to add Tamron superzoom when a safari/wildlife trip is booked.

> ⚠️ **NEW Finding (Feb 2026):** Analysis of 1,280 photos at 300mm+ shows heavy usage
> at 450-720mm ("telescope documentary" shots). HX90's extreme reach
> is harder to retire than initially thought for nature/wildlife trips.
> See [Deep Dive: 105mm+ Analysis](deep-dive-105mm-plus-analysis).

---

**🥇 Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN Contemporary** - ~\$900-1,100 | **Best Kit Simplification**

**Why this lens:**
- **Same 20mm wide end:** Breaks your 24mm constraint (matches SEL2070G)
- **Full-frame 70-200mm quality:** Massive upgrade over HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor at telephoto
- **Retire the HX90 for city trips:** Simplify to 2 devices instead of 3
- **Skip future 70-200mm investment:** Complete coverage now, no additional lens needed later

**⚠️ Important Trade-offs (per LensTip review):**
Severe 20mm moustache distortion (-8.55%) and tele pincushion at 200mm (+3.21%)
(see [LensTip Distortion chapter](https://www.lenstip.com/716.6-Lens_review-Sigma_C_20-200_mm_f_3.5-6.3_DG_Distortion_and_field_of_view.html));
dramatic vignetting at 20mm f/3.5 on full frame (~81%, -4.81 EV)
(see [LensTip Vignetting chapter](https://www.lenstip.com/716.8-Lens_review-Sigma_C_20-200_mm_f_3.5-6.3_DG_Vignetting.html));
edges soften at 200mm.

**Choose this if:** You want to simplify kit for city trips;
accept the optical compromises and keep HX90 only for nature/wildlife trips

> ⚠️ **HX90 Note:** New analysis reveals 300-720mm "telescope documentary" shots
> are harder to replicate than expected. Consider keeping HX90 for nature trips
> even with this superzoom. See [Can You Retire the HX90?](can-you-retire-hx90)

---

**🌟 Option 1C: Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy** - ~\$1,100 now + ~\$1,000-1,300 later | **Staged Investment**

**Why this strategy:**
- **Buy SEL2070G now:** G-series quality for 95%+ of city trips where 70mm is sufficient
- **Buy Tamron 25-200mm later:** Only when safari/wildlife trip is actually planned
- **No optical compromises:** Avoid Sigma's distortion issues entirely
- **Defer superzoom cost:** May not need it for years—or ever
- **HX90 bridges the gap:** Keep for rare city telephoto; essential for nature trips' 300-720mm needs

**Choose this if:** Most trips are city travel;
safari/wildlife trips are planned events;
you prefer buying the right tool when actually needed

---

**🌟 Option 1D: Reverse Staged Investment Strategy** - ~\$1,000-1,300 now + ~\$1,100 later | **Balanced Immediate Upgrade**

**Why this strategy:**
- **Buy Tamron 25-200mm now:** Instant quality leap for BOTH 25-70mm AND 70-200mm ranges
- **25mm = no loss vs current kit:** Your A550 + SAL1650 has 24mm equivalent anyway
- **Immediate telephoto upgrade:** No waiting — you use 70-200mm on city trips too, not just safari
- **Buy SEL2070G later:** Only if you genuinely need 20mm wide-angle or G-series perfection
- **Minimize unused lens risk:** May never need SEL2070G if 25mm serves you well

**Choose this if:** You want balanced upgrade across all focal lengths NOW;
immediate 70-200mm quality matters;
you're okay staying at 25mm wide end (same as your current 24mm)

**Camera Body: Sony A7C II or A7 IV** - ~\$2,200-2,500

**Why these bodies:**
- **33MP sweet spot:** Perfect resolution balance - high quality without overkill file sizes
- **Excellent high-ISO:** Clean ISO 6400 compensates for f/4 lens in low light
- **AI autofocus:** Reliable tracking for children on the move
- **Travel-optimized:** IBIS, weather sealing, vari-angle screen; A7 IV adds dual card slots

**Choose A7C II if:** Lightest weight (514g) and smallest size are priorities
for travel with child

**Choose A7 IV if:** You prefer traditional DSLR-style grip
and more substantial feel (658g, better ergonomics)

**Important:** Both cameras share the same 33MP sensor, but AF/handling and feature details differ.
Main difference is ergonomics vs portability; A7C II is more compact, while A7 IV offers a larger grip and dual card slots.
Try both in person before deciding - grip comfort is highly subjective.

### 📊 Key Findings from Your Data

**Your Shooting Evolution (2004-2025):**
- **Early years (2004-2009):** 35-50mm normal lens era
- **Transition (2012-2016):** 24mm wide-angle revolution (50-75% at 24mm)
- **Recent years (2017-2025):** 23-27mm ultra-wide dominance (65-80% of shots)

**Mobile Phone Integration (16,932 photos, 2006-2026):**
- **74% shot at 23-29mm** - mirrors your 24mm dedication on dedicated cameras
- **22% of total photography** - mobile is now a primary camera, not backup
- **Samsung S25 usage:** 64% at 23mm, 15% at 69mm (3x tele), 8% at 13mm (ultra-wide)

**What You Don't Need:**
- ❌ **Dedicated 70-200mm telephoto zoom** - the recommended 85mm prime covers portraits;
  consider Sigma 20–200mm or Tamron 25–200mm superzoom
  for full-frame quality in the 70-200mm range
- ❌ **Ultra-wide zoom (10-18mm)** - Mobile phone 13mm handles this superbly
- ❌ **24-105mm** - Dead zone at 50-70mm,
  doesn't go wide enough (24mm still limiting)

**What You Might Still Need:**
- ⚠️ **HX90 for nature/wildlife trips** — New analysis of 300mm+ photos (1,280 shots)
  reveals heavy usage at 450-720mm for "telescope documentary" captures.
  While superzoom replaces HX90 for city trips,
  its 720mm reach remains valuable for Svalbard-type encounters.
  See [Can You Retire the HX90?](can-you-retire-hx90) for details.
- ⚠️ **HX90 for competition sports photography** — Diving school analysis (2,894 photos)
  shows 7.6% at 385mm ceiling for action shots.
  **However:** For casual club activities, superzoom's 200mm → 300mm (APS-C crop)
  offers **better image quality** than HX90 despite 85mm less reach.
  Keep HX90 primarily for competition shoots from spectator stands (15-30m away).
  See [Sports/Action Photography (Diving School)](#sportsaction-photography-diving-school-2011-2012) for details.

**NEW Finding (Feb 2026): 105-299mm Quality Upgrade**
- Your 105-299mm shots (2,036 photos analyzed) are primarily portraits,
  distant scenes, and details to emphasize.
- These **deserve full-frame quality** — significant upgrade over HX90's 1/2.3-inch sensor.
- Superzoom or dedicated 70-200mm addresses this gap.

**NEW Alternative:** Consider **Sigma 20–200mm f/3.5–6.3 DG DN Contemporary**
or **Tamron 25–200mm f/2.8–5.6 Di III VXD G2** superzooms
for full-frame quality in the 70-200mm range, with trip-specific HX90 usage
for 300-720mm "telescope" needs
(see [Option 1B](option-1b-sigma-20-200mm-f35-63-dg-dn---best-kit-simplification)
and [Reference: Superzoom Comparison](reference-superzoom-lens-comparison-sigma-vs-tamron)
for details).

## Your Current/Planned Gear Context

- 🔍 **85mm f/1.8 prime** - Recommended for portraits (~\$550-600)
- ✅ **Sony HX90** (24–720mm equivalent) - Auxiliary camera for telephoto needs
- ✅ **Mobile phones** - 13mm/23mm/27mm ultra-wide and wide angles
- 🔍 **Main zoom lens** - To be determined (this recommendation)

**Implication:** Your main dedicated camera lens should focus on the **20–70mm range**
(or 20-200mm for kit simplification),
since ultra-wide needs (13-18mm) are well-served by your mobile phone,
portraits will be covered by the recommended 85mm f/1.8 prime,
and super-telephoto (100-720mm) is handled by the HX90 backup camera.

**Key Mobile Insight:**

Your mobile phone is NOT just a backup - it's a deliberate creative choice:
- When you want 13mm ultra-wide drama
- When you want 23-27mm convenience
- When you want 69mm telephoto without changing lenses
- When you want to travel light with your child

**Impact on Lens Recommendation:**

With 74% of mobile shots at 23-29mm and 8% at 13mm ultra-wide,
your mobile ALREADY covers:
- Ultra-wide storytelling (13mm)
- Standard wide-angle (23-27mm)
- Modest telephoto (69mm)

This makes 20–70mm dedicated lens even MORE logical -
it fills the quality gap without duplicating mobile convenience.

(5-cumulative-coverage-percentages)=
#### 5. **Cumulative Coverage Percentages**

Analyzing frequency distributions across all major travel collections:

| Focal Length Range | Typical Coverage | Notes                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **23-24mm alone**  | 40-70%           | Single most-used focal length |
| **23-35mm**        | 65-85%           | Core wide-angle range         |

| **100mm+**         | 1-5%             | Rare usage (covered by HX90)  |

(6-what-you-dont-use)=
#### 6. **What You DON'T Use**

- **Super-telephoto (300mm+):** <2% even on dedicated trips
- **Mid-range (50-69mm):** "Dead zone" with minimal usage
- **Ultra-telephoto (600-720mm):** <1% total (HX90 backup only)

(7-special-use-cases-identified)=
#### 7. **Special Use Cases Identified**

**Portrait Sessions (Baby Photos 2021-2022):**

- **One-month photos (Dec 2021):** Median 52mm, most used 75mm (27%) and 45mm (31%)
- **100-day photos (Mar 2022):** Median 33mm, most used 33mm (34%) and 24mm (26%)
- **Half-year photos (May 2022):** Median 42mm, most used 67mm (14%) and 52-75mm (12-13% each)
- Pattern: Mixed focal length usage with telephoto
  for flattering portraits (67-75mm) and wider angles (24-45mm) for environmental baby shots

**Budapest 2016 (Portrait-Focused Trip):**

- High 75mm usage (100% of main camera shots - 124 photos)
- **Context:** Using SAL1650 on Sony A550 (16-50mm, ~24-75mm equiv)
- **Reason:** 75mm was the telephoto end of available lens
  during dedicated portrait session
- **Not representative of general travel** - specialized portrait work, not typical shooting

**Landscape Travel (Most trips):**

- Absolute dominance: 23-24mm wide angle
- 60-80% of all shots in ultra-wide to wide range

**Museum/Gallery Photography (Musée du Louvre 2015-2018):**

- **668 photos** across 5 visits with focal length data
- **74.85% at 24mm** - extreme wide-angle dominance in indoor museum settings
- **Median: 24mm, Mean: 38mm** - even more wide-angle focused than outdoor travel
- **2018 visit (244 photos):** 90.16% at 24mm - most concentrated wide-angle usage
- **2016 visit (218 photos):** 78.90% at 24mm
- **Pattern:** Indoor museum/gallery photography is almost exclusively wide-angle
  - Capturing full artworks and architectural context
  - Limited space for backing up = ultra-wide necessity
  - Telephoto virtually unused (<5% beyond 50mm)
- **Implication:** SEL2070G's 20mm wide end is IDEAL for museum visits;
  confirms your wide-angle preference extends to all photography contexts

**Sports/Action Photography (Diving School 2011-2012):**

- **2,894 photos** across 34 folders (training sessions, competitions, school events)
- **Focal range:** 17mm – 500mm, **Mean: 96mm, Median: 52mm**
- **Bimodal distribution** — fundamentally different from travel photography
- **Wide-angle cluster (21% at 24mm):** Pool/venue context, group shots, environmental
- **Telephoto cluster (28% at 105mm+):** Capturing divers in action from poolside
  - **105mm:** 198 photos (6.84%) — most common mid-telephoto for training documentation
  - **385mm:** 220 photos (7.60%) — the longest focal length used in these photos
  - **300-500mm band:** 284 photos total, 77% concentrated at 385mm ceiling
- **Why telephoto dominates action shots:**
  - Indoor pools have restricted poolside access (safety regulations)
  - Divers move fast — need reach to fill frame without cropping
  - 385mm “ceiling effect” = max focal length available was used extensively
- **Pattern contrast vs travel photography:**
  | Metric       | Travel Photography | Diving School         |
  | ------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
  | 24mm usage   | 65-80%             | 21%                   |
  | 105mm+ usage | <5%                | 28%                   |
  | Mean focal   | 30-40mm            | 96mm                  |
  | Distribution | Single-mode (wide) | Bimodal (wide + tele) |
- **Implication for lens strategy:**
  - Sports events justify keeping HX90 for 300-500mm reach
  - **But wait — APS-C crop mode changes the math:**
    - 200mm superzoom × 1.5 APS-C crop = **300mm equivalent**
    - 180mm f/2.8 × 1.5 APS-C crop = **270mm equivalent**
    - Resolution drops: 33MP → ~14MP (A7C II/A7 IV), but still sharp
    - **14MP full-frame crop >> HX90's 18MP on 1/2.3" sensor** for image quality
  - **Revised assessment for club activities (non-professional):**
    - 300mm (superzoom + APS-C) vs 385mm (HX90) = only 1.28× reach difference
    - With cropping headroom from 14MP, effective reach gap is minimal
    - **Superzoom in APS-C mode likely sufficient** for diving club documentation
    - Quality advantage: larger pixels, better high-ISO, more detail
  - **When HX90 still wins:** Competition photography from spectator stands (15-30m away),
    where every mm of reach matters and you can't crop further
  - **Realistic conclusion:** For occasional club activities,
    superzoom's 200mm (300mm APS-C) offers **better quality** than HX90's 385mm;
    keep HX90 only for competition shooting where maximum reach is essential

**Sports & School Events (Future Consideration):**

- **Diving school data validates** the need for telephoto at sports events
- **Typical event scenarios and lens recommendations:**
  | Event Type                | Distance         | Recommended Approach                           |
  | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
  | **Club training/casual**  | Close (5-10m)    | Superzoom 200mm → 300mm (APS-C) — best quality |
  | **Swimming/diving meets** | Far (15-30m)     | HX90 720mm or superzoom 300mm + heavy crop     |
  | **Sports days/track**     | Variable         | Superzoom 300mm (APS-C) usually sufficient     |
  | **School plays/concerts** | Seating (10-20m) | Superzoom 70-200mm — f/5.6 adequate with IBIS  |
  | **Graduation ceremonies** | Seating          | Superzoom 100-200mm — plenty of reach          |
- **APS-C crop mode insight:** Superzoom's 200mm → 300mm equivalent at 14MP
  delivers **better image quality** than HX90's 385mm on tiny sensor
- **When to use what:**
  - **Superzoom (APS-C mode):** Club activities, school events, casual sports — better quality
  - **HX90:** Competition photography from spectator stands — maximum reach essential
- **Implication:** For most sports/action events, superzoom suffices;
  keep HX90 specifically for competition shoots where extreme reach trumps quality

  - 67% of HX90 shots at 24mm - even backup camera used wide
- **Czech Republic 2013 (Prague):** 70% at 24mm, mean 30mm
  - Highest 24mm concentration in entire dataset
  - Historic architecture and narrow streets = ultra-wide necessity
- **Japan 2024 (Recent trip):** Similar 45-50% at 24mm pattern
  - Consistency across 6-year gap validates urban wide-angle preference

**Nordic Landscapes (Svalbard, Lofoten, Norway):**

- **Svalbard 2015 (Arctic):** Mean 233mm on HX90 (telescopic distant subjects)
  - 43% at 24mm on HX90 (landscapes)
  - 21-22% at 75mm on main camera (distant wildlife, icebergs)
  - Combination of vast landscapes (wide) + distant subjects (telephoto)
- **Lofoten 2015:** 34% at 24mm + 35% at 29mm (iPhone), mean 36mm
  - More balanced focal length distribution
  - 23% at 75mm for dramatic landscape compression
  - Telephoto usage 2-3x higher than typical travel
- **Pattern:** Open landscapes create opportunity for telephoto compression
  - BUT still 60-70% in wide-angle range overall

**Mediterranean/Cultural Travel (Tunisia, Turkey, Balkans):**

- **Tunisia 2013:** 83% at 35mm (iPhone 4S convenience)
  - Low dedicated camera usage - relied on mobile phone
  - Travel style: Less photography-focused, more experiential
- **Turkey 2014:** Diverse range with strong 24mm core
  - Cultural sites favor wide environmental shots
- **Spain trips:** Consistent 24mm dominance for architecture

**SAGA Norway & Iceland 2014-2015 (14-day winter expedition):**

- **2,426 photos across 14 days (Dec 28 - Jan 9)** - per folder analysis
- **New Year's Eve alone (12/31):** 324 photos, 60% at 24mm, 17% at 75mm
  - Highest volume shooting day shows your natural wide-angle preference
- **Overall trip pattern:** 39% at 24mm + 12% at 75mm + 12% at 33mm + 7% at 105mm
  - Extended Arctic trip showed most diverse focal length usage of any trip
  - Wide variety due to: landscapes (24mm), aurora (24mm), distant subjects (105mm), portraits (75mm)
- **Arctic winter landscapes:** Primarily wide-angle for vast scenery,
  with telephoto for distant landscape features and northern lights

**Key Insights:**

- **Urban = 65-75% ultra-wide** (24mm constraint, likely want even wider)
- **Landscapes = 55-70% wide-angle** + 15-25% telephoto compression
- **Casual travel = mobile convenience** (23-35mm single focal length)
- **Photography-focused trips = more focal length diversity** (but still 60%+ wide)

**Implication for Lens Choice:**

### Trip Duration & Photography Volume Patterns

Analyzing how trip length affects your shooting volume and focal length diversity:

**Short Trips (1-3 days):**

- **Photo volume:** 100-400 photos
- **Focal length pattern:** 70-85% concentrated at primary wide-angle (24mm) for travel
- **Device:** Often mobile-only or minimal camera usage
- **Examples:**
  - Stavanger 2013 (3 days): 206 photos, 77% at 24mm
  - Graduation 2014: 188 photos, 84% at 24mm
  - Note: Portrait sessions show different patterns (e.g., Stupskolen baby photos: 72 photos, median 60mm, 39% at 75mm)
- **Behavior:** Stick with proven wide-angle for environmental shots, telephoto for dedicated portraits

**Medium Trips (4-7 days):**

- **Photo volume:** 600-1,200 photos
- **Focal length pattern:** 50-70% at primary wide + 15-25% telephoto
- **Device:** Dedicated camera + mobile + occasional HX90
- **Examples:**
  - Czech Republic 2013 (5 days): 882 photos, 71% at 24mm

  - Turkey 2014 (12 days): 4,000+ photos, diverse focal length usage
- **Behavior:** More focal length exploration, balanced shooting

**Extended Trips (10+ days):**

- **Photo volume:** 3,000-5,000+ photos
- **Focal length pattern:** More diverse, but still 50-60% wide-angle core
- **Device:** All devices used extensively
- **Examples:**
  - Japan 2018 (18 days): 4,508 photos, 45% at 24mm + significant tele usage
  - SAGA Norway & Iceland 2014-2015 (14 days): 2,426 photos, 39% at 24mm overall (60% on highest-volume day)
  - Caucasus 2017 (15 days): 3,500+ photos, wide range distribution
- **Behavior:** Experimentation increases, but wide-angle remains dominant

**Photography Volume by Trip Type:**

| Trip Duration | Avg Photos/Day | Primary FL Usage | FL Diversity |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1-3 days      | 100-150        | 70-85% at 24mm   | Low          |
| 4-7 days      | 150-200        | 50-70% at 24mm   | Medium       |
| 8-14 days     | 250-350        | 45-60% at 24mm   | High         |
| 15+ days      | 200-300        | 50-65% at 24mm   | Medium-High  |

**Insights:**

1. **Longer trips = more focal length experimentation** (but wide-angle still dominates)
2. **Daily rate peaks at 250-350 photos** for major trips, then stabilizes
3. **You shoot MORE on photography-focused trips** (Japan, Caucasus) vs casual travel
4. **Short trips = comfort zone** (24mm ultra-wide almost exclusively)

**Implication:**

Even on extended trips with time for experimentation:

- 50-65% of shots remain in 20-35mm range
- Telephoto use increases to 15-25% (covered by 85mm + HX90)
- Mid-range 50-70mm emerges as useful (5-15%)
- **SEL2070G covers 90-95% even on diverse, long trips**

- **Insight:** Even with the SAME landscape, you shoot wider (24mm) than companions (29-33mm)

**Tunisia 2013: Photographer Style Comparison**

- **"Tunisia Pics" subfolder:** 28 photos, 43% at 27mm, diverse range to 72mm
  - Someone else's compact camera (likely travel companion)
  - More telephoto usage (14% at 42mm, 7% at 72mm)
- **Your mobile:** 140 photos, 100% at 35mm (iPhone 4S)
- **Pattern:** Companions explore focal lengths; you stick to proven wide

**Czech Republic 2013: Personal Style**

- **Your photos (root):** 750 photos, 72% at 24mm
- **"Patty" subfolder:** 112 photos without EXIF (companion's photos?)
- **Your "Selected":** 100 photos, 84% at 24mm
- **Clear signature:** 24mm is YOUR voice, regardless of destination

**SAGA Norway & Iceland 2014-2015: Solo Shooting**

- **No companion folders** - entirely your vision
- **2,426 photos across 14-day Arctic expedition**
- **Pattern:** 39% at 24mm overall, with individual high-volume days reaching 60% at 24mm
- **Most diverse trip:** 12% at 75mm, 12% at 33mm, 7% at 105mm shows focal length variety when time allows

**Key Insights:**

1. **Your 24mm preference is PERSONAL STYLE, not situational**
   - Same destinations, different photographers = different focal lengths
   - You consistently choose wider than companions
2. **Companions shoot 29-35mm; you shoot 24mm**
   - Given the same scenes, you frame wider
   - This validates wanting even wider (20mm SEL2070G)
3. **Your consistency = photographic voice**
   - Not indecision or limitation
   - Deliberate aesthetic choice honed over 21 years
4. **Companion photos often LACK your wide-angle signature**
   - Their 35mm normal perspective vs your 24mm environmental style
   - Your wide-angle storytelling is what makes your photos YOURS

**Bottom Line:**

Your 65-80% wide-angle usage isn't because:

- ❌ "That's all you had" (companions had same gear, shot differently)
- ❌ "That's what the destination required" (same locations, different choices)
- ❌ "You don't know better" (21 years of consistent evolution)

**It's because:**

- ✅ **Wide-angle is your photographic voice**
- ✅ **Environmental storytelling is your strength**
- ✅ **23-27mm is YOUR signature perspective**

**SEL2070G's 20mm start honors this while giving you MORE of what you love.**

| Trip Type                      | Lens to Pack               | Why                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **City travel (95% of trips)** | SEL2070G 20–70mm           | Best quality, covers your 65-80% zone          |
| **Safari/wildlife**            | Tamron 25–200mm            | Need telephoto reach; telephoto-dominant       |
| **Sports events**              | Tamron 25–200mm            | Need telephoto for action                      |
| **Mixed nature** (see below)   | SEL2070G + Tamron 25–200mm | G-series for landscapes + full-frame telephoto |
| **Mixed/uncertain**            | SEL2070G + HX90            | G-series quality + HX90 telephoto backup       |

**📍 What Are "Mixed Nature" Trips?**

Trips that combine **urban/landscape photography** (your 65-80% wide-angle dominant style)
with **meaningful wildlife/telephoto opportunities** — but aren't dedicated safaris.

**Examples from your photo history:**
- **Svalbard 2015** — Longyearbyen town + polar bear encounters
- **Lofoten 2017** — Coastal villages + seabird colonies + distant mountain shots
- **Inner Mongolia 2009** — Grassland landscapes + wildlife encounters
- **Norwegian nature trips** — Fjord scenery + occasional wildlife

**Why bring both lenses (SEL2070G + Tamron)?**

| Focal Range         | Primary Lens        | Reasoning                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **20-70mm**         | **SEL2070G**        | G-series quality for your dominant 65-80% of shots  |
| **70-200mm**        | **Tamron 25-200mm** | Full-frame telephoto quality (massive HX90 upgrade) |
| **25-70mm overlap** | Use SEL2070G        | Better optical quality in the overlap zone          |

**The strategy:** SEL2070G stays mounted 90% of the time.
You swap to Tamron **only when telephoto opportunities arise**
(wildlife spotted, distant mountain detail, seabird colony).

**When does two-lens "mixed nature" make sense?**
- You expect **distinct telephoto moments** (not constant back-and-forth)
- Wildlife encounters are **predictable/planned** (boat trips to seabird cliffs, scheduled wildlife viewing)
- You're willing to swap lenses **a few times per day** (not constantly)
- The 70-200mm quality gain over HX90 justifies the extra weight (~570g)

**When to just bring Tamron 25-200mm alone?**
- Wildlife opportunities are **unpredictable** throughout the day
- You can accept 25mm wide end (vs 20mm on SEL2070G)
- Lens swapping with a 4-year-old feels impractical

(why-this-makes-sense-for-you)=
#### Why This Makes Sense for You

**1. Your Data Supports This:**
- 65-80% of shots at 20-35mm (city street/architecture).
- Telephoto usage concentrates on specific trip types (Svalbard wildlife: 22% at 75mm).
- Most travel is city-based where 70mm is sufficient.

**2. HX90 as City Telephoto Backup:**
- For rare moments like "interesting thing happening far away".
- You're "recording" not "photographing artistically" — HX90 suffices.
- No need to carry superzoom on every city trip "just in case".

**3. Financial Flexibility:**
- Spend ~\$1,100 now instead of ~\$2,000-2,300.
- Defer ~\$1,200 superzoom purchase until actually needed.
- If safari trip never materializes, you've saved money.
- If it does, buy the right tool at the right time.

**4. Avoids Superzoom Compromises:**
- No Sigma's severe 20mm distortion (-8.55%) on your primary lens.
- No vignetting concerns at wide end.
- No "weak 200mm" compromising telephoto shots when you DO need them.
- Tamron's f/2.8-5.6 better than Sigma's f/3.5-6.3.

(when-to-buy-the-superzoom)=
#### When to Buy the Superzoom

**Buy Tamron 25-200mm when:**
- ✅ Safari or wildlife trip is booked.
- ✅ Child's sports events become frequent.
- ✅ You find yourself wanting more telephoto reach consistently.
- ✅ HX90 telephoto quality is frustrating you.

**Don't rush to buy if:**
- ❌ No specific telephoto-heavy trip planned.
- ❌ HX90 is covering your occasional telephoto needs adequately.
- ❌ Your trips remain primarily city-focused.

(why-tamron-over-sigma-for-phase-2)=
#### Why Tamron Over Sigma for Phase 2

If you eventually buy a superzoom, **Tamron 25-200mm f/2.8-5.6** is preferable:
- **Faster aperture throughout:** f/2.8 at 25mm vs Sigma's f/3.5 at 20mm.
- **Better telephoto aperture:** f/5.6 at 200mm vs Sigma's f/6.3.
- **VXD linear motor AF:** Fast, accurate for moving subjects
  (wildlife, sports).
- **5mm narrower at wide end (25mm vs 20mm):** Acceptable since SEL2070G handles wide-angle.

The 25mm wide end isn't a problem because:
- You're NOT using this for city travel (SEL2070G handles that).
- Safari/wildlife rarely needs ultra-wide.
- You're optimizing for telephoto performance, not wide-angle.

**Bottom Line:** This staged approach gives you
**best-in-class quality for 95% of your trips now**,
with the **option to add telephoto capability later**
without being locked into a compromised superzoom.
Your instinct is correct—this is a smart, financially flexible strategy.

(detour-70-180mm-f28)=
### 🔎 Detour: What About a Dedicated 70-180mm f/2.8?

**The temptation:** The **Tamron 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VXD G2** (~\$1,200-1,300)
offers constant f/2.8 aperture throughout the zoom range.
If your telephoto shots are often blurred due to slow shutter speeds,
wouldn't a fast f/2.8 telephoto solve this better than f/5.6 superzooms?

#### Technical Comparison: 70-180mm f/2.8 vs Tamron 25-200mm (Telephoto Section)

| Aspect                    | **Tamron 70-180mm f/2.8 G2** | **Tamron 25-200mm** (at 70-200mm)   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Aperture at 70mm**      | **f/2.8 (constant)**         | ~f/4 (variable)                     |
| **Aperture at 180-200mm** | **f/2.8 (constant)**         | f/5.6                               |
| **Light advantage**       | **2 stops faster at tele**   | Slower shutter = more blur risk     |
| **Shutter speed example** | 1/500s @ f/2.8 ISO 800       | 1/125s @ f/5.6 ISO 800 (same light) |
| **Weight**                | ~805g                        | ~570g (but covers 25-200mm)         |
| **Price**                 | ~\$1,200-1,300               | ~\$1,000-1,300                      |
| **Range**                 | 70-180mm only                | 25-200mm all-in-one                 |

**The blur problem diagnosed:** At 180-200mm, the 25-200mm gives you f/5.6.
To get sharp handheld shots at 200mm, you typically need **1/200s minimum** (reciprocal rule).
At f/5.6, achieving this in anything but bright daylight requires high ISO or IBIS compensation.
The **f/2.8 constant aperture gives you 2 extra stops** —
enabling 1/500s where the f/5.6 would only manage 1/125s.

#### Does 70-180mm f/2.8 Fit Your Shooting Style?

**The fundamental problem:** Your data shows you're a **wide-angle storyteller**.
Using HX90's tiny sensor for wide-angle (to pair with 70-180mm)
would sacrifice quality where you shoot most (65-80% at 20-35mm).

| Scenario                          | **70-180mm f/2.8 Makes Sense?** | **Reasoning**                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **City travel (90% of trips)**    | ❌ **No**                        | You'd need SEL2070G anyway; creates redundant kit                       |
| **Wildlife/safari trips**         | ⚠️ **Partial**                   | Better telephoto quality, but still want SEL2070G for 65-80% wide shots |
| **Dedicated telephoto day**       | ✅ **Yes**                       | Zoos, bird photography — telephoto dominates                            |
| **Low-light telephoto events**    | ✅ **Yes**                       | Indoor performances, evening wildlife — f/2.8 shines                    |
| **Field/court sports**            | ✅ **Yes**                       | Soccer, basketball, dance recitals — f/2.8 helps in gyms/evening light  |
| **Pool sports (diving/swimming)** | ❌ **No**                        | Diving school data: 7.6% at 385mm — 180mm reach insufficient            |

#### When 70-180mm f/2.8 Genuinely Makes Sense

1. **Dedicated wildlife/bird photography days** —
   Leave SEL2070G behind, bring only 70-180mm + HX90 for "just in case" wide shots

2. **Indoor events** (school plays, concerts) —
   f/2.8 at 180mm lets you capture without flash from back of venue

3. **Field/court sports** — Soccer, basketball, skating —
   action at distance where f/2.8 prevents motion blur; 180mm reach is sufficient

4. **Evening safaris/wildlife** —
   Dawn/dusk is when animals are active and light is challenging

5. **As a *supplement* to your kit** (not replacement) —
   Bring it *in addition to* SEL2070G for trips where telephoto matters

#### When 70-180mm f/2.8 Falls Short: Diving School Evidence

**Your diving school data (2,894 photos) reveals a critical limitation:**

- **7.6% at 385mm** (220 photos) — max focal length used in these photos
- **77% of 300-500mm shots concentrated at 385mm** — hitting the lens ceiling constantly
- **180mm (270mm APS-C) falls 115mm short** of the 385mm you actually used

**But APS-C crop mode offers a practical alternative** for casual club activities:
- Superzoom's 200mm → 300mm (APS-C) at 14MP delivers **better image quality** than HX90's 385mm
- Reach gap is only 1.28× — often acceptable for non-professional documentation
- See [Sports/Action Photography (Diving School)](#sportsaction-photography-diving-school-2011-2012) for detailed analysis

**Bottom line:** For competition photography from spectator stands, HX90's 385-720mm reach wins.
For casual club activities where you're closer to the action, superzoom in APS-C mode offers
better quality despite 85mm less reach.

#### APS-C Crop Mode: Extended Reach Option

**Modern full-frame cameras offer APS-C crop mode** that extends reach:

| Lens                 | Native (FF) | APS-C Crop (1.5×) | Resolution (A7C II)  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Tamron 70-180mm**  | 180mm       | **270mm**         | ~14MP                |
| **Tamron 25-200mm**  | 200mm       | **300mm**         | ~14MP                |
| **HX90 (reference)** | 720mm       | N/A               | 18MP (1/2.3" sensor) |

**Key insight:** 14MP from full-frame APS-C crop >> 18MP from HX90's tiny sensor
for detail, noise, and dynamic range. For more analysis, see
[Sports/Action Photography (Diving School)](#sportsaction-photography-diving-school-2011-2012).

#### Is a Dedicated 70-180mm f/2.8 Worth It for Infrequent Sports?

**For diving/swimming — probably not.** See detailed analysis in
[Sports/Action Photography (Diving School)](#sportsaction-photography-diving-school-2011-2012).

**Quick comparison:**

| Factor                       | **70-180mm f/2.8**         | **Superzoom (25-200mm)** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Max reach (APS-C mode)**   | 270mm                      | **300mm**                |
| **Light gathering**          | **f/2.8 (2 stops better)** | f/5.6                    |
| **Versatility**              | 70-180mm only              | **25-200mm all-in-one**  |
| **Need separate wide lens?** | Yes (+\$1,100)             | **No**                   |

**Verdict:** Superzoom's 300mm (APS-C) achieves better reach than 70-180mm's 270mm,
and the f/2.8 advantage is limited for well-lit indoor pools where you need
fast shutter speeds (1/500s+) regardless of aperture.

#### Verdict on 70-180mm f/2.8

**The 70-180mm f/2.8 genuinely solves blur problems** at telephoto,
but **probably doesn't fit your documented patterns well**:

- ✅ It **genuinely solves your blur problem** at telephoto (up to 180mm / 270mm APS-C)
- ❌ It **creates a kit gap** unless paired with another wide lens
- ❌ Using HX90 for wide-angle **sacrifices quality where you shoot most**
- ❌ Your telephoto usage (10-20%) doesn't justify dedicated premium glass
- ⚠️ For pool sports: **superzoom's 300mm (APS-C) > 70-180mm's 270mm (APS-C)** for reach
- ⚠️ It makes a **~\$2,300-2,400 two-lens kit** (SEL2070G + 70-180mm)
  vs **~\$1,100** for SEL2070G alone

**Better alternatives for your blur concerns:**
1. **Maximize IBIS usage** — A7C II/A7 IV provides 5+ stops stabilization
2. **Accept slightly higher ISO** — Modern full-frame sensors are clean to ISO 6400
3. **Tamron 25-200mm + APS-C crop** — 300mm equivalent with better quality than HX90
4. **Keep HX90 only for competitions** — when maximum reach (720mm) matters more than quality

**The 70-180mm f/2.8 becomes compelling only if** you develop a specific telephoto-heavy use case
(wildlife photography hobby, **field/court** sports coverage, event photography)
that your data doesn't currently show.

**For pool sports (diving, swimming):**
- **Casual club activities:** Superzoom 200mm → 300mm (APS-C) is sufficient and better quality
- **Competition photography:** HX90's 720mm still wins for maximum reach from spectator stands

### ⭐ **Option 1D: Reverse Staged Investment (Tamron Now + SEL2070G Later)**

> 💡 **This is the opposite of Option 1C.** Instead of prioritizing G-series quality at 20-70mm first,
> this strategy prioritizes a **balanced immediate upgrade** across ALL focal lengths.

**This approach addresses concerns about waiting for telephoto quality improvement
while providing a massive upgrade over your current A550 + SAL1650 kit:**

(the-core-insight-opposite-of-1c)=
#### The Core Insight: Opposite of 1C

Option 1C says: *"Buy the best quality where you shoot most (20-70mm), defer telephoto."*

Option 1D says: *"Buy good quality everywhere NOW, defer perfection."*

**Your current kit reality:**
- Sony A550 + SAL1650 = **24mm equivalent starting point**
- Tamron 25-200mm = **25mm starting point (essentially the same)**
- The comparison isn't "Tamron vs SEL2070G" — it's "A7Cii + Tamron vs A550 + SAL1650"

From that perspective, **even Tamron's "superzoom compromises" represent a dramatic upgrade**
in your primary 25-70mm zone — just not G-series perfection.

(the-reverse-strategy)=
#### The Reverse Strategy

**Phase 1: Buy Tamron 25-200mm Now (~\$1,000-1,300)**
- Covers 25-200mm with full-frame quality on A7Cii.
- **25mm wide end = no regression** from your current 24mm equivalent.
- **Instant telephoto quality leap:** 70-200mm goes from HX90's 1/2.3-inch sensor to full-frame.
- **f/2.8 at 25mm, f/5.6 at 200mm** — faster than Sigma throughout the range.
- You use 70-200mm on city trips too, not just safari — why wait?

**Phase 2: Buy SEL2070G Later (If Needed, ~\$1,100)**
- Purchase only if you genuinely need 20mm wide-angle.
- Purchase if you want G-series optical perfection at 20-70mm.
- Could be months, years, or never — defer the expense.
- **Mobile 13mm ultra-wide** bridges dramatic wide-angle needs in the meantime.

| **Mixed nature** (after Ph. 2) | Both lenses       | G-series for landscapes, Tamron for wildlife  |

(why-1d-makes-sense-for-you)=
#### Why This Makes Sense for You

**1. Your Data Supports This:**
- **25mm ≈ 24mm** — You've been shooting at 24mm for years; 25mm is essentially the same.
- **70-200mm usage is real:** You mentioned using this range on city trips, not just safari.
- **A550 → A7Cii is the big upgrade:** Even Tamron's "compromises" are dramatically better than your current kit.

**2. Immediate Balanced Upgrade:**
- Option 1C gives "perfection in one zone, nothing in another" initially.
- Option 1D gives "very good everywhere" immediately.
- No waiting for telephoto quality improvement.

**3. You Use 70-200mm Regularly:**
- Unlike Option 1C which assumes telephoto is only for safari.
- Your city trips include telephoto moments worth capturing well.
- **Instant quality leap from HX90** — no more waiting.

**4. Minimal Unused Lens Risk:**
- If 25mm serves you well (it's what you've had for years), you may **never need SEL2070G**.
- Avoids accumulating lenses you don't really use.
- If you DO need 20mm or G-series quality later, SEL2070G is always available.

**5. Mobile Bridges Ultra-Wide Gap:**
- Samsung S25's 13mm ultra-wide handles dramatic wide shots.
- 8% of your S25 photos are at 13mm — you actively use this when needed.
- The 20mm vs 25mm difference may matter less than you think.

(when-to-buy-sel2070g)=
#### When to Buy SEL2070G

**Buy SEL2070G if:**
- ✅ You genuinely miss the 20mm wide-angle after using 25mm.
- ✅ Architecture photography with critical straight lines becomes important.
- ✅ You want G-series optical perfection for serious landscape work.
- ✅ The 25-70mm overlap doesn't bother you (use SEL2070G for city, Tamron for safari).

**Don't rush to buy if:**
- ❌ 25mm is serving you well (it's what you've had for years).
- ❌ Mobile 13mm handles your ultra-wide needs.
- ❌ You're happy with Tamron's 25-70mm quality (which is still a massive upgrade from A550).

**Bottom Line:** Option 1D is the **"balanced upgrade now, perfection later"** approach.
It trades G-series excellence at 20-70mm for **immediate quality improvement everywhere**,
including the 70-200mm range you use on city trips.
Your instinct is correct — this is a pragmatic strategy that minimizes waiting
and reduces the risk of accumulating lenses you don't need.

### Why Consider Superzooms Over SEL2070G + HX90

**1. Higher Quality in 70-200mm Range Than HX90**

- **HX90 reality:** 1/2.3-inch sensor class, small aperture at telephoto end.
- **These lenses:** Full-frame quality at 70-200mm on A7C II/A7 IV.
- **Image quality jump:** Dramatic improvement for telephoto shots.
- **Low-light advantage:** f/5.6-6.3 at 200mm >> HX90's effective aperture at equivalent focal length.

**2. Skip Investing in 70-200mm Later**

- **Traditional approach:** SEL2070G (20-70mm) + eventually 70-200mm f/4 (~\$1,500 + ~\$1,400 = ~\$2,900).
- **Superzoom approach:** One lens covers 20-200mm or 25-200mm (~\$900-1,300).
- **Cost savings:** Potentially ~\$1,600 saved
  if you never buy 70-200mm.
- **Simplicity:** One lens instead of two for travel.

**3. Retire the HX90 — With Important Caveats**

- **Current HX90 role:** 24-720mm backup for telephoto (2-5% of shots).
- **Superzoom coverage:** 70-200mm range with full-frame quality.
- **What you lose:** 200-720mm extreme telephoto — **but this matters more than initially thought**
  (see [Deep Dive: 105mm+ Analysis](deep-dive-105mm-plus-analysis)).
- **What you gain:** One less device, better quality telephoto, simpler kit.

**⚠️ Updated Assessment (Feb 2026):**

New analysis of 1,280 photos at 300mm+ reveals significant usage
at 450-720mm range ("telescope documentary" shots).
While HX90 can be retired for **city trips** (90% of your travel),
it remains valuable for **nature/wildlife trips** where 720mm reach
enables capturing memorable moments you'd otherwise miss.

**Recommendation:** Consider trip-specific HX90 usage rather than full retirement.
See [Can You Actually Retire the HX90?](can-you-retire-hx90) for detailed analysis.

### 📸 Image Quality Comparison Across Focal Ranges

**Understanding the quality differences helps clarify when compromises matter:**

#### At 70-200mm: Superzoom vs HX90 — "Bicycle vs Sedan"

Even with optical compromises, the Sigma 20-200mm on full-frame is **dramatically better**
than HX90 in the 70-200mm range. The comparison isn't close:

| Factor               | **Sigma on Full-Frame**                 | **HX90**               | Winner                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Sensor size**      | Full-frame (860mm²)                     | 1/2.3-inch (~28mm²)    | **Sigma: 30x larger** |
| **Light gathering**  | ~30x more light                         | Tiny photosites        | **Sigma**             |
| **High ISO**         | Clean to ISO 6400+                      | Noisy above ISO 400    | **Sigma: 3-4 stops**  |
| **Dynamic range**    | ~14 stops                               | ~10-11 stops           | **Sigma: 3-4 stops**  |
| **Detail at 200mm**  | "Weak" for full-frame = still excellent | Limited by sensor      | **Sigma**             |
| **Crop flexibility** | Can crop 2-3x and retain quality        | Cropping degrades fast | **Sigma**             |

**Key insight:** The Sigma's "compromises" are **relative to premium full-frame lenses**
(like Sony 70-200mm f/4 G). Compared to HX90's 1/2.3-inch sensor:
- Even the Sigma's "weakest point" (200mm edges) delivers **massively more detail**
- The full-frame sensor's low-light advantage alone is worth 3-4 stops
- A "soft" corner on full-frame still contains more information than HX90's sharp center

**Practical impact for your 105-299mm photos (2,036 analyzed):**
- **Portraits with compression** — Full-frame bokeh and skin tones far superior
- **Distant scenes** — More detail retention for cropping
- **Indoor/low-light** — ISO 3200 on full-frame vs ISO 400 on HX90

#### At 20-70mm: Sigma vs SEL2070G — "Economy Sedan vs Luxury Sedan"

Both are full-frame lenses on the same sensor, so we're comparing **lens optics only**:

| Factor                         | **Sigma 20-200mm**            | **Sony SEL2070G** | Difference               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Center sharpness**           | Excellent                     | Excellent         | **~Equal**               |
| **Edge/corner sharpness**      | Good-to-soft                  | Excellent         | **SEL2070G better**      |
| **20mm distortion**            | **-8.55% barrel** (moustache) | Minimal           | **SEL2070G much better** |
| **Vignetting at 20mm**         | Heavy (-4.81 EV)              | Well-controlled   | **SEL2070G better**      |
| **Aperture**                   | f/3.5-6.3 (variable)          | f/4 (constant)    | Trade-off*               |
| **Chromatic aberration**       | Moderate                      | Well-corrected    | **SEL2070G better**      |
| **Software correction needed** | Significant                   | Minimal           | **SEL2070G easier**      |

*Sigma is slightly faster at 20mm (f/3.5 vs f/4) but slower by 50mm onwards

**When you'll likely notice the SEL2070G advantage:**
- Shooting architecture with straight lines at 20mm (moustache distortion visible)
- Pixel-peeping corners in landscape shots
- Printing large (>16x20 inches)
- Shooting wide-open at 20mm (vignetting)

**When you likely won't notice:**
- Shooting casually for social media/web
- Subject is centered
- Photos viewed at normal sizes
- Camera applies auto-corrections (modern Sony bodies do this)

#### Summary: Quality Gap by Focal Range

| Comparison                   | Quality Gap                                      | Analogy                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| HX90 vs Superzoom (70-200mm) | **Massive** — different sensor classes           | Bicycle vs Sedan                     |
| Sigma vs SEL2070G (20-70mm)  | **Noticeable** — same sensor, lens optics differ | Economy Sedan vs Luxury Sedan        |
| Sigma vs Tamron (70-200mm)   | **Modest** — both full-frame, Tamron has edge    | Mid-trim Sedan vs Fully-loaded Sedan |

**This is exactly why Option 1C recommends:**
- **SEL2070G for city trips** — G-series quality where you shoot 65-80% of photos
- **Tamron 25-200mm for safari trips** — Full-frame telephoto quality matters more than 20mm perfection

#### At 70-200mm: Sigma vs Tamron — "Mid-trim vs Fully-loaded Sedan"

When comparing the two superzooms specifically in the telephoto range:

| Factor                   | **Sigma 20-200mm**    | **Tamron 25-200mm** | Advantage                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Aperture at 200mm**    | f/6.3                 | **f/5.6**           | **Tamron: 2/3 stop faster**         |
| **Aperture at 70mm**     | ~f/5                  | **~f/4**            | **Tamron: ~1 stop faster**          |
| **Zoom ratio**           | 10x (more extreme)    | 8x (less extreme)   | **Tamron: less optical compromise** |
| **200mm sharpness**      | Weakest point of lens | Better optimized    | **Tamron likely better**            |
| **AF motor**             | Standard              | VXD linear motor    | **Tamron: faster/quieter**          |
| **Low-light capability** | Decent                | Better              | **Tamron**                          |

**Why Tamron is likely better at telephoto:**

1. **Less extreme zoom range** — 8x vs 10x means the Tamron can allocate more optical "budget"
   to the tele end rather than stretching to 20mm

2. **Faster aperture throughout** — f/5.6 at 200mm vs f/6.3 means:
   - 2/3 stop more light (faster shutter or lower ISO)
   - Slightly better subject isolation (shallower DOF)

3. **Wide end is already "sacrificed"** — Tamron starts at 25mm,
   which means the lens design can prioritize telephoto performance

4. **VXD linear motor AF** — Faster, quieter autofocus for tracking moving subjects

**Practical impact for your safari/wildlife use case (Option 1C Phase 2):**
- Tamron's f/5.6 at 200mm helps with moving wildlife (faster shutter)
- Tamron's VXD AF is faster for tracking animals
- Both are dramatically better than HX90 — but Tamron has the edge

**This reinforces why Option 1C recommends Tamron for Phase 2:**
The 25mm wide end isn't a problem because you already have SEL2070G for wide-angle.
When buying a superzoom specifically for safari/wildlife/telephoto-heavy trips,
optimize for telephoto quality (Tamron) rather than wide-angle reach (Sigma).

### 📊 Data-Based Analysis: Do You Need 200mm?

**Your telephoto usage patterns (from focal length analysis):**

| Trip             | 70-200mm Range Usage | 200mm+ Usage    | Notes                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Japan 2018       | ~17% at 75mm         | <2% at 200mm+   | HX90: 10% of shots at telephoto |
| Japan 2024       | ~16% at 69mm (phone) | <1% at 200mm+   | Mobile tele sufficient          |
| Lofoten 2015     | ~23% at 75mm         | Minimal         | Landscape compression           |
| Svalbard 2015    | ~22% at 75mm         | 7% at 100-200mm | Wildlife/Arctic exceptions      |
| Samsung S25 2025 | ~15% at 69mm         | ~1% at 230mm+   | Digital zoom rarely used        |

**Key insight:** Your telephoto usage concentrates heavily at 70-85mm
for portraits and subject isolation.
The 100-200mm range is used sparingly (5-10% of trips),
and 200mm+ is extremely rare (<2%).

**Key Use Cases Identified:**
- **Portraits with compression:** Friends at gatherings, travel companions, children
- **Distant scenes:** Mountain details, harbor views, architectural details from distance
- **Details to emphasize:** Signs, artworks in museums, specific elements in busy scenes
- **Events and performances:** Stage shots, street performances, festival moments

**Quality Assessment:** These shots benefit significantly from full-frame quality upgrade.
The HX90's 1/2.3-inch sensor limits detail retention in this range.
**Verdict: Full-frame 70-200mm quality is desirable here.**

#### 300mm+ Range (1,280 photos analyzed)

**Statistical Summary:**
- **Mean focal length:** 483mm (35mm equivalent)
- **Median focal length:** 452mm
- **Range:** 300-802mm
- **Peak concentrations:** 385mm (10.3%), 452mm (11.4%), 500mm (8.0%), 720mm (12.5%)

**Usage Patterns - "Telescope Documentary" Style:**
- **300-450mm (~45%):** Moderate telephoto reach for distant subjects
- **450-600mm (~33%):** Heavy concentration — this is your "telescope sweet spot"
- **600-720mm (~22%):** Maximum reach for wildlife, distant landmarks

**Key Use Cases Identified (NOT traditional "photography" per se):**
- **Wildlife encounters:** Svalbard polar bears, birds at Inner Mongolia, zoo animals
- **Distant landmarks:** Mountain peaks, distant buildings, ships on horizon
- **Memorable moments/spots:** "Interesting things along trips" — documentary, not portfolio
- **Festivals and events:** Grunnlovsdag parade, performances from distance
- **Unexpected encounters:** Birds, animals, distant activity worth recording

**Critical Insight:**
> These 300mm+ shots "don't necessarily have photographic value,
> but still [capture] memorable moments/spots."

This is **telescope-style documentary photography** — recording what you saw,
not creating portfolio-worthy images. The HX90's role is enabling these captures at all,
even if quality is compromised.

(can-you-retire-hx90)=
### 🎯 Can You Actually Retire the HX90?

**Short Answer: It's hard to fully retire the HX90 for your shooting style.**

#### The APS-C Crop Mode Reality Check

Some may suggest using APS-C crop mode on Sony A7C II/A7 IV
to extend telephoto reach:

| Full-Frame Lens | APS-C Crop Mode | Effective Resolution       |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 200mm           | 300mm equiv     | **14MP** (from 33MP)       |
| 200mm + 1.4x TC | 420mm equiv     | **14MP** + TC quality loss |

**The Problem:**
- You'd completely lose the **450-720mm range** that you demonstrably use
- 14MP may suffice for social media, but limits printing/cropping flexibility
- Teleconverters add cost, weight, and optical degradation
- **Your data shows heavy usage at 452mm (11.4%) and 720mm (12.5%)**

#### Trip-Type Analysis: When Can HX90 Be Retired?

| Trip Type                       | Can Retire HX90? | Reasoning                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **City travel (90%)**           | ✅ **Yes**        | 200mm full-frame + APS-C crop (300mm) likely suffices; rare telephoto needs |
| **Nature/wildlife trips (10%)** | ❌ **No**         | Svalbard-type trips need 450-720mm reach for documentary shots              |
| **Sports competitions**         | ❌ **No**         | Diving school data: 385mm heavily used from spectator stands (15-30m)       |
| **Sports club activities**      | ✅ **Yes**        | Superzoom 300mm (APS-C) offers better quality when closer to action         |
| **Mixed/uncertain**             | ⚠️ **Keep HX90**  | Lightweight (245g) insurance for unexpected encounters                      |

#### Practical Recommendation

**For city trips (90% of your travel):**
- Superzoom or dedicated 70-200mm provides massive quality upgrade over HX90 at 105-200mm
- These shots (portraits, distant scenes, details) **deserve full-frame quality**
- APS-C crop to 300mm handles occasional longer reach needs

**For nature/wildlife trips (10% of your travel):**
- HX90's 720mm reach remains valuable for "telescope" documentary shots
- Even if not portfolio-quality, it **enables capturing moments you'd otherwise miss**
- Its 245g weight is negligible insurance for Svalbard-type encounters

**Verdict:** Keep HX90 for occasional nature trips or unexpected wildlife encounters.
It serves a niche your superzoom/full-frame simply cannot replicate.
Retire it from city trips where its role is adequately covered by better equipment.

### Detailed: Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN Contemporary

**Pros:**

- ✅ **20mm wide end** - Matches your proven preference (same as SEL2070G).
- ✅ **200mm telephoto** - Eliminates 70-200mm lens need, replaces HX90 role.
- ✅ **10x zoom range** - One lens covers nearly everything.
- ✅ **Full-frame quality** - Massive upgrade over HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor at telephoto.
- ✅ **Compact for range** - Contemporary line prioritizes portability.
- ✅ **Better low-light** - f/3.5 at wide end vs HX90's smaller sensor.
- ✅ **Very good center sharpness** - Excellent resolution from 20-100mm (per LensTip testing).
- ✅ **Silent, accurate autofocus** - Quick AF with low focus breathing.
- ✅ **1:2 macro mode** - Added versatility for close-up work.

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **Slower aperture at telephoto** - f/6.3 at 200mm (vs f/4 on premium zooms).
- ⚠️ **No 200-720mm** - Loses HX90's extreme telephoto (rarely needed per data).
- ⚠️ **f/3.5-6.3 variable aperture** - Less consistent than f/4 constant aperture.

**⚠️ Critical Optical Concerns (from LensTip technical review, Jan 2026):**

- ❌ **Severe distortion at 20mm** - Up to -8.55% barrel distortion
  with pronounced "moustache" pattern on full frame.
  LensTip: *"I haven't seen such vicious moustache for a very long time."*
  While software correction brings this down to -0.61%,
  this correction **costs pixels and effective resolution**.
- ❌ **Significant pincushion distortion at telephoto** - +3.21% to +3.48% at 100-200mm range
- ❌ **Heavy vignetting on full frame** - Listed as major con; requires correction
- ❌ **200mm is the weak point** - Sharpness drops notably at maximum focal length, especially at frame edges. Decent images only around f/8.
- ❌ **Resolution penalty from distortion correction** -
  The massive geometric corrections
  "waste a significant number of pixels and limit effective image resolution"

**📊 What This Means for Your Use Case:**

| Concern                  | Impact on Your Photography                                         | Mitigation                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **20mm distortion**      | Architecture with straight lines will show bowing unless corrected | Auto-correction works but reduces effective resolution                            |
| **Moustache distortion** | Horizon lines may appear wavy at edges at 20mm                     | Most visible in landscapes with clear horizons                                    |
| **200mm softness**       | Telephoto portraits/details less sharp than premium 70-200mm       | Stop down to f/8 for best results; the 85mm prime handles portraits better anyway |
| **Vignetting**           | Dark corners on full frame, especially at 20mm                     | Software correctable but adds post-processing                                     |

**Balanced Assessment:**

The Sigma 20-200mm delivers **excellent center sharpness**
across most of its range (20-100mm)
and represents a remarkable engineering achievement for a 10x superzoom.
However, it relies heavily on software correction for distortion and vignetting—
a common trade-off in modern superzooms.
For **casual travel photography** where you're not pixel-peeping or printing large,
these compromises are acceptable.
For **architecture photography with critical straight lines**
or **edge-to-edge sharpness demands**,
the SEL2070G remains the better choice for your primary 20-70mm zone.

**Data-based coverage:** 95%+ of your shooting needs, replaces both SEL2070G range AND HX90 role

### Detailed: Tamron 25-200mm f/2.8-5.6 Di III VXD G2

- ✅ **VXD linear motor AF** - Fast, accurate autofocus for moving children.
- ✅ **Tamron quality** - Known for excellent superzoom optical performance.
- ✅ **Full-frame 200mm quality** - Dramatically better than HX90 at telephoto.

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **25mm wide end** - 5mm narrower than your preferred 20mm (same as old 24mm constraint).
- ⚠️ **Repeats 24-25mm limitation** - Doesn't break your historical wide-angle constraint.
- ⚠️ **Still variable aperture** - Though faster than Sigma.
- ⚠️ **No 200-720mm** - Loses extreme telephoto reach.

**Data-based coverage:** 90-95% coverage, but wide end doesn't improve on your 24mm history

(recommendation-sigma-vs-tamron-for-your-use-case)=
### 🎯 Recommendation: Sigma vs Tamron for Your Use Case

**Choose Sigma 20-200mm if:**
- ✅ **You value the 20mm wide end** (matches SEL2070G, breaks your 24mm constraint).

*Per LensTip technical review, Jan 2026. Software correction handles most issues automatically.

**Option 3 (16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime):** Not included in table above
as it's a specialized ultra-wide setup that accepts a 35-85mm gap.
Best for landscape-focused photographers who prioritize the widest possible field
of view (16mm) over versatility. See [Option 3](#option-3-16-35mm-f4-ultra-wide-specialist) for details.

### Final Verdict on Superzoom Strategy

**Consider Option 1B (Sigma 20-200mm) IF:**

1. ✅ **Higher 70-200mm quality matters NOW** - HX90's small sensor limits telephoto quality.
2. ✅ **You want to retire HX90** - Simplify to one main lens.
3. ✅ **You rarely use 200mm+** - Your data shows <2% usage above 200mm.
4. ✅ **You value kit simplicity** - One superzoom vs SEL2070G + HX90 combo.
5. ✅ **You want to avoid future 70-200mm purchase** - Complete coverage now.
6. ✅ **You shoot primarily for memories, not pixel-peeping** - Casual travel/family photography.
7. ✅ **You accept software distortion correction** - Modern cameras handle this automatically.

**Stick with SEL2070G IF:**

1. ✅ **Optical quality at 20-70mm is priority** - G-series beats superzoom at this range.
2. ✅ **You shoot architecture with critical straight lines** - Sigma's 20mm distortion may bother you.
3. ✅ **You want edge-to-edge sharpness without compromise** - Superzoom has inherent trade-offs.
4. ✅ **You want 200-720mm option** - Keep HX90 for rare extreme telephoto.
5. ✅ **f/4 constant aperture matters** - More predictable exposure.
6. ✅ **You may still buy 70-200mm later** - SEL2070G + 70-200 f/4 = premium two-lens kit.

The LensTip technical review revealed the Sigma 20-200mm
has **more optical compromises than initially expected**, particularly:
- Severe barrel distortion (-8.55%) and moustache pattern at 20mm
- Heavy vignetting on full frame
- 200mm being the weakest focal length for sharpness

**However**, the review also confirmed:
- Excellent center sharpness from 20-100mm
- Good edge sharpness on APS-C crop
- Fast, accurate autofocus
- Very good image quality for a 10x superzoom

**Practical Recommendation:**

The Sigma 20-200mm remains compelling for your use case IF:
- You shoot primarily for travel memories and family documentation
- You accept that software correction handles distortion automatically
- You value the massive simplicity gain over pixel-perfect results
- Your 200mm usage is occasional (the 85mm prime handles portraits better anyway)

**However, the SEL2070G recommendation is strengthened because:**
- Your 65-80% wide-angle usage means the 20-70mm quality matters most
- The G-series optics provide noticeably better results where you shoot most
- The Sigma's distortion at 20mm may be visible in architecture/landscape shots
- If you later want premium telephoto, adding a 70-200mm f/4 gives you best-in-class at both ranges

**Consider Option 1C (Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy) IF:**
- Most of your trips are city travel where 70mm is sufficient.
- Safari/wildlife trips are planned events (you know months ahead).
- You want G-series quality NOW without optical compromises.
- You prefer buying the right tool when actually needed.
- HX90 is adequate for rare city telephoto shots (2-5% of shots).
- You may not need a superzoom for years—defer the investment.

**Consider Option 1D (Reverse Staged Investment) IF:**
- You want **balanced upgrade across ALL focal lengths NOW** — not just 20-70mm.
- You use 70-200mm regularly on city trips, not just safari.
- 25mm wide end is acceptable (same as your current 24mm equivalent).
- You prefer **immediate telephoto quality leap** over waiting.
- You want to minimize unused lens accumulation — may never need SEL2070G.
- Mobile 13mm ultra-wide can handle dramatic wide shots when needed.

**Bottom Line:**
- **Maximum quality at 20-70mm:** SEL2070G + HX90 (Option 1A)
- **Maximum convenience for city trips:** Sigma 20-200mm (Option 1B)—but with optical caveats per LensTip review;
  still consider keeping HX90 for nature/wildlife trips
- **G-series first with staged investment:** SEL2070G now + Tamron later (Option 1C)
- **Balanced immediate upgrade:** Tamron now + SEL2070G later (Option 1D) — **Also Recommended**
  if you want quality improvement everywhere NOW

**NEW Insight (Feb 2026):** Analysis of 1,280 photos at 300mm+ reveals heavy usage
at 450-720mm for wildlife/documentary shots. While 105-299mm photos (2,036 analyzed)
deserve full-frame quality upgrade, the extreme telephoto range is harder to replace.
**Consider trip-specific HX90 usage rather than full retirement.**

**Note:** Both Sigma 20-200mm and Tamron 25-200mm are newer
lenses - verify availability and read early reviews before purchasing.

## 🎒 Practicality Reality Check: Two Zooms (20-70mm + 70-200mm) on Non-Photography Trips

**A critical consideration often overlooked in gear discussions:**

Your trips are **not photography-dedicated**—
you're traveling with a 4-year-old,
balancing family experiences with documentation.
This fundamentally changes the calculus for a two-zoom kit.

(the-two-zoom-dream-vs-reality)=
### The Two-Zoom Dream vs. Reality

**The Traditional Enthusiast Kit:**
- 20–70mm f/4 G for wide-to-normal coverage
- 70-200mm f/4 G for telephoto reach
- Combined: ~970g lens weight, ~\$2,500 investment

**Sounds perfect on paper. But consider your actual travel rhythm:**

### Why Two Zooms May Not Suit Your Travel Style

**1. Lens Changes Are Photography Interruptions**

When your child spots something exciting,
you have seconds to capture the moment—not time to:
- Stop walking
- Open your bag
- Swap lenses carefully
- Store the removed lens
- Resume the moment (which may have passed)

Your data shows **65-80% of shots at 20-35mm**—
meaning the 70-200mm would sit in your bag most of the time,
occasionally needed but requiring a disruptive workflow.

**2. Weight Penalty Is Constant, Usage Is Sporadic**

| Consideration                | SEL2070G Only | Two-Zoom Kit    | Superzoom       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Lens weight on body**      | 488g          | 488g OR 1,090g* | ~570g           |
| **Bag weight (backup lens)** | None          | 488g OR 1,090g* | None            |
| **Total lens weight**        | 488g          | 1,578g          | ~570g           |
| **70-200mm usage**           | 0% (use HX90) | 10-20%*         | 100% (built-in) |
| **Lens changes/day**         | 0             | 3-8 typical*    | 0               |

*Estimated based on your telephoto usage patterns

You carry the **weight penalty constantly**
but only benefit from the second lens **occasionally**.

**3. The "Just in Case" Trap**

Two-zoom photographers often report:
- Bringing both lenses "just in case"
- Leaving the 70-200mm mounted on camera (heavier all day)
- OR leaving it in bag and missing shots because switching takes too long
- Returning home with 90% of shots on the wide zoom anyway

Your data validates this concern:
even on photography-focused trips (Japan 2018, SAGA 2014-2015),
wide-angle dominated at 45-60% of shots.

**4. Family Travel Context Matters**

When you're:
- Holding your child's hand crossing streets
- Carrying their snack bag, water bottle, spare clothes
- Responding to "Look at that!" moments
- Navigating crowded tourist sites
- Dealing with nap time, bathroom breaks, meal logistics

**The last thing you need is lens-swap workflow complexity.**

### When Two Zooms WOULD Make Sense

**1. Photography-Dedicated Trips (Solo or Adult-Only)**
- Intentional landscape or wildlife photography
- Planned portrait sessions
- Time and mental space for gear optimization
- *Not your typical travel pattern*

**2. Safari or Wildlife Scenarios**
- Predictable subjects at distance
- Vehicle-based shooting (gear accessible)
- Long periods of stationary observation
- *Rare in your documented travel history*

**3. Sports/Event Photography**
- Dedicated shooting position
- Extended coverage at single focal length
- *Not your primary use case*

### Why Superzooms Exist: Solving the Two-Zoom Problem

The Sigma 20-200mm and Tamron 25-200mm represent a deliberate compromise:

| Factor                      | Two-Zoom Kit       | Superzoom Solution |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Coverage**                | 20-200mm (same)    | 20-200mm (same)    |
| **Lens changes**            | Multiple per day   | Zero               |
| **Weight**                  | ~1,500g            | ~570g              |
| **Missed moments**          | Swapping-induced   | Minimal            |
| **Optical quality**         | Excellent per lens | Good overall       |
| **Travel-with-child score** | ⚠️ Complex          | ✅ Practical        |

**The superzoom trade-off**: Slightly lower optical quality across the range
in exchange for dramatically simpler workflow and lighter kit.

(your-data-supports-single-lens-simplicity)=
#### Your Data Supports Single-Lens Simplicity

**Evidence from your shooting patterns:**

1. **Mobile phone usage: 22% of all shots** → You value convenience
2. **HX90 as "backup" rather than primary** → You don't enjoy device-juggling
3. **65-80% at 20-35mm** → You'd rarely use the second lens
4. **"Selected" photos favor wide-angle MORE** → Your best work doesn't need 70-200mm
5. **Multi-camera trips still show wide-angle dominance** → Even with options, you gravitate to wide

### Practical Recommendation for Non-Photography Trips

**For your typical family travel:**

| Option                                   | Recommendation              | Why                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1A: SEL2070G + HX90**           | ✅ Good choice               | G-series quality + HX90 telephoto backup       |
| **Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm**            | ✅ **Strongly recommended**  | One lens, zero swaps, full coverage            |
| **Option 1C: SEL2070G (+ Tamron later)** | ✅ **Excellent flexibility** | Right tool for each trip; city OR mixed nature |
| **Option 1D: Tamron (+ SEL2070G later)** | ✅ **Balanced upgrade**      | One lens, full coverage, better tele than 1B   |
| **SEL2070G + 70-200mm**                  | ⚠️ **Consider carefully**    | Substantial complexity for occasional benefit  |
| **Three-lens kit**                       | ❌ Avoid                     | Diminishing returns, maximum hassle            |

**Key principle:** Match your gear complexity to your trip type.
- Photography trip → Consider two zooms
- Safari/wildlife trip → Tamron 25-200mm alone (Option 1C Phase 2 or Option 1D Phase 1)
- Mixed nature trip → SEL2070G + Tamron 25-200mm (both lenses, swap as needed)
- Family/casual city travel → SEL2070G alone (1A/1C) or Tamron alone (1D)

### The Decision Matrix

**Choose SEL2070G + 70-200mm IF:**
- ❓ You're willing to change lenses multiple times daily
- ❓ You value maximum telephoto quality over convenience
- ❓ You have dedicated photography time during trips
- ❓ Weight isn't a primary concern
- ❓ You're comfortable with complex workflows

**Choose Superzoom (Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm) IF:**
- ✅ Your trips are not photography-dedicated
- ✅ You're traveling with a young child
- ✅ You value moment-capture over maximum quality
- ✅ Lens changes feel like interruptions
- ✅ You want the simplest possible workflow NOW
- ⚠️ You accept the optical trade-offs (20mm distortion, 200mm weakness)

**Choose Two-Lens Flexibility (Option 1C) IF:**
- ✅ Most trips are city travel where 70mm is sufficient
- ✅ Safari/wildlife trips are planned events (you know ahead)
- ✅ You want G-series quality without compromise on city trips
- ✅ You prefer staged investment (buy superzoom only when needed)
- ✅ HX90 adequately handles rare city telephoto needs
- ✅ For "mixed nature" trips, you're willing to bring both lenses and swap as needed

**Choose Reverse Staged Investment (Option 1D) IF:**
- ✅ You want balanced upgrade across ALL focal lengths NOW
- ✅ You use 70-200mm regularly on city trips too, not just safari
- ✅ 25mm wide end is acceptable (same as your current 24mm equivalent)
- ✅ You prefer immediate telephoto quality leap over waiting
- ✅ You want single-lens simplicity like Option 1B but with better telephoto quality
- ✅ Mobile 13mm ultra-wide can bridge dramatic wide-angle needs
- ⚠️ You accept not having 20mm wide-angle initially (but can add SEL2070G later)

**This analysis supports multiple strategies depending on your priorities.
For maximum simplicity NOW, Option 1B (Sigma) or **Option 1D (Tamron)**.
For maximum quality in your primary zone, Options 1A or 1C.**

(important-considerations-a7c-ii-vs-a7-iv)=
#### ⚠️ **Important Considerations: A7C II vs A7 IV**

**Your Concerns Are Valid - Here's the Reality:**

**1. Ergonomics & Handling (A7C II "Too Small" Concern):**

**A7C II Grip Reality:**
- **Shallow grip depth** - Some find it cramped, especially with larger lenses.
- **Rangefinder-style body** - Different from traditional DSLR ergonomics.
- **Smaller front grip** - Less to hold onto compared to A7 IV.
- **Better with smaller lenses** - Works great with SEL2070G (488g), less ideal with heavy telephotos.

**Who struggles with A7C II grip:**
- Photographers with larger hands (though you mentioned yours aren't big).
- Those upgrading from DSLR-style cameras (muscle memory expects deeper grip).
- Users who frequently shoot with heavy lenses (24-70mm f/2.8 GM at 886g).
- Anyone who values tactile controls over compact size.

**Who loves A7C II grip:**
- Mirrorless-first shooters (no DSLR habits to break).
- Street/travel photographers prioritizing low profile.
- Users pairing with compact lenses (like SEL2070G f/4).
- Those coming from compact cameras or smartphones.

**Practical solution if concerned:** Try both in a camera store before buying.
The A7C II feels VERY different from A7 IV - this is highly personal.

**2. Build Quality & Robustness (A7 IV More Robust Concern):**

**Build Quality Comparison:**

| Aspect                   | A7C II         | A7 IV               | Verdict                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Weather sealing**      | ✅ Full sealing | ✅ Full sealing      | **Equal** - both weather-sealed |
| **Magnesium alloy body** | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes               | **Equal** - same materials      |
| **Shutter durability**   | 200,000 cycles | 200,000 cycles      | **Equal**                       |
| **Port covers**          | Plastic        | Metal               | **A7 IV better**                |
| **Button feel**          | Compact/tight  | Larger/more tactile | **A7 IV better**                |
| **Overall robustness**   | Very good      | Excellent           | **A7 IV slightly better**       |

**Reality Check:**

- **Both are professional-grade cameras** - Neither is "fragile"
- **Weather sealing identical** - Both handle rain, dust, light snow
- **A7C II is NOT a "toy camera"** - Same internal construction as A7 IV
- **Main difference: Size, not strength** - Compact doesn't mean weak

**Where A7 IV feels more robust:**
- **Metal port covers** vs plastic on A7C II (HDMI, USB-C, mic).
- **Larger buttons** - easier to press with gloves, less accidental presses.
- **Deeper grip** - feels more "planted" in hand during active shooting.
- **Psychological factor** - bigger = feels more substantial (even if specs are similar).

**Where concerns are overstated:**
- A7C II has same magnesium alloy chassis.
- Same shutter mechanism and durability rating.
- Same lens mount strength.
- Both cameras can handle professional use.

**For Your Use Case (Casual Travel Photography with Family):**

**A7C II is sufficiently robust if:**
- ✅ You're not shooting in extreme conditions (Antarctic expedition, monsoon).
- ✅ Primary use is travel/family photography (not professional sports/wildlife).
- ✅ You care about carrying lighter gear while chasing a 4-year-old.
- ✅ You pair with lighter lenses (SEL2070G is perfect match).

**Choose A7 IV if:**
- ⚠️ You value the "feel" of a substantial camera body.
- ⚠️ You want the most comfortable all-day handling.
- ⚠️ The 144g weight penalty doesn't concern you.
- ⚠️ You prefer traditional DSLR-style ergonomics.

**Honest Assessment for Your Situation:**

**Ergonomics:** The A7C II grip IS smaller - this is real, not imagined.
If you've never held a compact rangefinder-style camera,
it WILL feel different. However, with the lightweight SEL2070G (488g),
the system is well-balanced. With heavier lenses, the grip becomes more noticeable.

**Robustness:** The difference is MINIMAL for real-world durability.
Both cameras will survive normal travel photography abuse.
The A7 IV's slight edge (metal port covers, larger buttons) matters more
for professional daily use than casual travel shooting.

**Recommendation:** If possible, **handle both cameras in a store** before deciding.
The grip size difference is subjective -
what feels cramped to one person feels perfect to another.
Your data shows you value portability (22% mobile usage),
but ergonomics trump weight if you can't comfortably hold the camera.

**Safe middle ground:** A7 IV offers peace of mind on both concerns
(better grip, slightly more robust feel)
for only ~\$100-200 more and 144g extra weight.
Given you're investing ~\$3,300–3,600 total,
the A7 IV premium might be worth it if the grip concern is genuine.

**High-Resolution Bodies NOT Suited for Your Needs:**

**Why A7R is Wrong for You:**

1. **Overkill resolution (61MP)**
   - Your mobile photos (22% of output) are 12MP - you're fine with that.
   - You don't print large (no mention in 21-year data).
   - Higher MP = larger files, slower workflow, more storage.

2. **File size burden**
   - 61MP RAW = ~120MB/file vs 33MP = ~65MB/file.
   - Japan 2018: 4,508 photos × 120MB = 541GB vs 293GB.
   - Storage/backup costs add up fast.

3. **Diminishing returns**
   - 65-80% wide-angle shooting doesn't benefit from high MP.
   - Telephoto crops could use it, but you shoot <10% telephoto.
   - SEL2070G f/4 isn't optimized for ultra-high resolution.

4. **Weight penalty**
   - A7R V: 723g vs A7C II: 514g (209g = 41% heavier).
   - Traveling with child = weight matters.

5. **Slower shooting**
   - Larger files = slower burst, slower buffer clearing.
   - Moving children need responsive camera, not maximum resolution.

6. **Price premium without benefit**
   - A7R V: ~\$3,900 vs A7C II: ~\$2,200.
   - Extra $1,700 buys ZERO practical benefit for your shooting.

**Data-based verdict:** 21 years of shooting shows you value convenience
and storytelling over technical specs. A7R is professional tool you don't need.

### 🎯 Final Camera Body Recommendation

**Buy Either Sony A7C II OR Sony A7 IV (Your Choice)**

**Both cameras are excellent choices - the decision comes down to personal preference:**

**Choose A7C II (~\$2,200-2,500, 514g) if:**
1. **Portability is your top priority** - Lightest full-frame available.
2. **You're comfortable with compact cameras** - No DSLR muscle memory.
3. **Weight matters more than grip size** - Every gram counts with a 4-year-old.
4. **You pair mainly with light lenses** - SEL2070G (488g) balances well.
5. **Budget-conscious** - Save $100-200 vs A7 IV.

**Choose A7 IV (~\$2,300-2,500, 658g) if:**
1. **Grip comfort is your top priority** - Traditional DSLR-style ergonomics.
2. **You want the most comfortable all-day handling** - Deeper grip, better button layout.
3. **The 144g weight penalty doesn't concern you** - Still reasonable for travel.
4. **You value a substantial feel** - Metal port covers, larger body inspires confidence.
5. **Peace of mind matters** - Better ergonomics = less hand fatigue on long shooting days.

**Critical: Try both in person before buying** - The grip difference is
significant and highly subjective. What feels "too small" to one person feels "perfect" to another.

**Your Complete Recommended Kit (Four Top Lens Strategies):**

The camera body options below work with any of the four top lens strategies (1A, 1B, 1C, or 1D).

## 🎯 Decision Guide: Choose Your Strategy

> 💡 **Practical Note:** Options 1A and 1C have the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~\$1,100).
> You don't need to decide between them now—buy the SEL2070G, use it, and decide later
> whether to keep HX90 indefinitely (1A) or add Tamron when a safari trip is planned (1C).

### Choose **SEL2070G 20-70mm f/4 G** (Options 1A or 1C) if:

- ✅ **Optical quality at 20-70mm is paramount** - G-series excellence in your 85-90% zone.
- ✅ You've been constrained by 24mm and want wider (20mm).
- ✅ You're okay keeping HX90 as telephoto backup (2-5% usage).
- ✅ **f/4 constant aperture matters** - predictable exposure.
- ✅ Budget: ~\$1,650-1,700 for lenses (SEL2070G + 85mm) is acceptable.
- ✅ **Best for:** Maximum quality in your primary shooting zone.

### Choose **Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN** (Option 1B) if:

- ✅ **You want to retire HX90 immediately** - simplify to 2 devices now
- ✅ **Better telephoto quality matters** - full-frame 70-200mm >> HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor
- ✅ **You want to skip future 70-200mm investment** - complete coverage now
- ✅ **Kit simplification is priority** - one lens covers 95%+
- ✅ **You shoot primarily for memories** - not pixel-peeping or large prints
- ✅ **You accept software distortion correction** - cameras handle this automatically.
- ⚠️ You accept the trade-offs: severe 20mm distortion, weaker 200mm edges, heavy vignetting.
- ✅ Budget: ~\$1,450-1,700 for lenses (Sigma + 85mm).
- ✅ **Best for:** Simpler kit with dramatically better telephoto—but **read the LensTip review**
  to understand optical compromises.

### Choose **Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy** (Option 1C) if:

- ✅ **Most trips are city travel** - don't need telephoto beyond 70mm.
- ✅ **You want G-series quality now** - no compromises at 20-70mm.
- ✅ **Safari/wildlife trips are predictable** - you know months ahead.
- ✅ **You prefer staged investment** - ~\$1,100 now, ~\$1,000-1,300 later (only if needed).
- ✅ **HX90 is adequate for rare city telephoto** - acceptable quality for 2-5% of shots.
- ✅ **You may not need superzoom for years** - defer the cost indefinitely.
- ✅ **When you DO need telephoto, you want quality** - Tamron f/2.8-5.6 beats Sigma f/3.5-6.3.
- ✅ Budget: ~\$1,650-1,700 now for lenses (SEL2070G + 85mm); superzoom ~\$1,000-1,300 can wait.
- ✅ **Best for:** Photographers who mostly travel cities and prefer buying the right tool when actually needed.

### Choose **Reverse Staged Investment** (Option 1D) if:

- ✅ **You want balanced upgrade across ALL focal lengths NOW** — not just 20-70mm.
- ✅ **You use 70-200mm on city trips too** — not just safari/wildlife.
- ✅ **25mm wide end is acceptable** — same as your current 24mm equivalent (no regression).
- ✅ **You prefer immediate telephoto quality leap** — no waiting for HX90 replacement.
- ✅ **You want single-lens simplicity** — like Option 1B, but with better telephoto quality (Tamron's f/5.6 > Sigma's f/6.3).
- ✅ **Mobile 13mm ultra-wide can bridge dramatic wide-angle needs** — you already use this 8% of the time.
- ✅ **You want to minimize unused lens risk** — may never need SEL2070G if 25mm serves you well.
- ⚠️ You accept not having 20mm initially — can add SEL2070G later if genuinely needed.
- ✅ Budget: ~\$1,550-1,900 now for lenses (Tamron + 85mm); SEL2070G ~\$1,100 is optional later.
- ✅ **Best for:** Photographers who want quality improvement everywhere NOW
  and may never need G-series perfection at wide-angle.

### Choose **24-70mm f/2.8 GM** if:

- ⚠️ You absolutely need f/2.8 for low-light work.
- ⚠️ Don't mind the extra weight (886g vs 488g).
- ⚠️ Budget allows $2,200.
- ⚠️ Willing to repeat 24mm limitation.
- ⚠️ **Not recommended for you.**

### Choose **16-35mm f/4** if:

- ⚠️ You prioritize ultra-wide over versatility.
- ⚠️ Don't mind carrying multiple lenses.
- ⚠️ Willing to accept 35-85mm gap.
- ⚠️ **Less ideal for your travel style.**

(critical-insights-about-your-photography)=
## ⚠️ Critical Insights About Your Photography

1. **24mm was your constraint, not your preference**

   - You shot 40-70% at 24mm because it was your ONLY wide option.
   - Given 20mm, you'll likely use it MORE than 24mm.
   - Mobile data shows you use 13mm ultra-wide 5-8% consistently
     (Samsung S22/S25).
   - When given 17-18mm ultra-wide on Huawei phones,
     you used it 13-14% of time.
   - **Conclusion:** You actively seek wider than 23-24mm when available.

2. **Budapest 75mm usage is misleading**

   - This was a portrait session, not typical travel.
   - 75mm was the far end of your SAL1650 lens at the time.
   - Not representative of your normal shooting patterns.
   - The recommended 85mm prime covers this specialized need.

3. **Your kit has evolved perfectly FOR the 20-70mm range**

   - Mobile handles ultra-wide (13mm) - 8% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - Mobile handles standard wide (23mm) - 64% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - Mobile handles 3x telephoto (69mm) - 15% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - 85mm prime handles dedicated portraits.
   - HX90 handles extreme telephoto (24-720mm backup).
   - **SEL2070G fills the quality gap:**
     20-70mm for serious photography.

4. **Single lens workflow matches your style**

   - 90-95% of shots in 20-70mm range.
   - You prefer convenience
     (evidenced by 16,932 mobile photos = 22% of total output).
   - Mobile usage accelerating: 3,296 photos in <1 year on Samsung S25.
   - Lens changing minimized = better travel experience.

5. **Mobile phone is your SECOND camera, not backup**

   - 16,932 mobile photos with intentional focal length choices.
   - 74% shot at primary wide (23-29mm) - deliberate storytelling choice.
   - Multi-camera phones: You actively switch between ultra-wide, wide, telephoto.
   - Samsung S25: Most balanced usage (64% primary, 15% tele, 8% ultra-wide, 5% mid-range).
   - This isn't "phone snapshot" behavior - it's intentional photography.

 (quick-reference-summary)=
## 📌 Quick Reference Summary

1. **Your shooting evolved**: Normal (35mm) → Wide (24mm) → Ultra-wide (13-23mm).
2. **24mm was historically your widest** - both SEL2070G and Sigma 20-200mm give you 20mm.
3. **Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 recommended** (~\$550-600) - dedicated portrait lens for low-light and shallow DOF.
4. **Mobile phone is a capable ultra-wide** - 13mm handles dramatic wide shots.
5. **HX90 role re-evaluated (Feb 2026):** Full retirement is harder than expected.
   - Retire for **city trips** (90%) where superzoom covers telephoto needs
   - Keep for **nature/wildlife trips** (10%) where 300-720mm "telescope" reach is valuable
   - See [Can You Retire the HX90?](can-you-retire-hx90) for detailed analysis
6. **105-299mm shots deserve quality upgrade** - portraits, distant scenes, details benefit from full-frame.
7. **300-720mm is "telescope documentary"** - capturing memorable moments, not portfolio shots.
8. **50-70mm is your "dead zone"** - minimal documented usage (but nice to have).
9. **Trip types are predictable** - city travel vs. safari/wildlife trips are planned differently.

**Four Top Strategies (Plus One Alternative):**

- **Best optical quality at 20-70mm:** SEL2070G (Options 1A/1C - G-series excellence in your 85-90% zone).
- **Best kit simplification for city trips:** Sigma 20-200mm (Option 1B - full-frame telephoto; keep HX90 for nature trips).
- **Best flexibility with G-series first:** Two-Lens Strategy (Option 1C - SEL2070G now + Tamron later when needed).
- **Balanced immediate upgrade:** Reverse Strategy (Option 1D - Tamron now + SEL2070G later if needed). **Also Recommended.**
- **Alternative - ultra-wide specialization:** 16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime (Option 3 - accept 35-85mm gap).
- **Options 1A/1C/1D break your 24mm constraint** with 20-25mm wide end; **1B gives 20mm** but with optical trade-offs.

## 🎯 Bottom Line: Your Optimal Lens Strategy

Based on 75,974 photos analyzed across 21 years
(59,042+ dedicated camera + 16,932 mobile),
you've proven you're a **wide-angle storyteller**
who values **environmental context** over **isolated subjects**.

**Mobile phone data confirms this:**

- 74% of your 16,932 mobile photos shot at 23-29mm wide angle
- When given ultra-wide (13-18mm), you use it 5-13% - proving you want WIDER
- Samsung S25: 64% at 23mm shows consistency with your 24mm dedication on dedicated cameras

With a young child, this style is PERFECT - it captures the experience, not just the subject.

### Your Four Top Strategies (Plus Alternative)

> 💡 **Practical tip:** Options 1A and 1C are the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~\$1,100).
> Option 1D starts with Tamron (~\$1,000-1,300) instead.
> Choose based on whether you prioritize G-series quality first (1A/1C) or balanced upgrade everywhere (1D).

| Option | Strategy                    | Why It Works for You                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1A** | SEL2070G (20-70mm f/4 G)    | Best optics in your 85-90% zone, light enough for travel with a 4-year-old             |
| **1B** | Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3    | Kit simplification for city trips; keep HX90 for nature trips (optical trade-offs)     |
| **1C** | SEL2070G now + Tamron later | Staged investment—G-series quality now, add telephoto when safari trips happen         |
| **1D** | Tamron now + SEL2070G later | Balanced upgrade everywhere NOW; telephoto quality instantly; SEL2070G if needed later |
| **3**  | 16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime    | *Alternative:* Ultra-wide specialization, accept 35-85mm gap                           |

**Most important tip:** The photos you'll treasure most aren't the technically perfect ones -
they're the ones that captured genuine moments.
Your wide-angle preference naturally creates these story-rich images.
Trust your instincts, keep it simple, and enjoy the adventure with your child.

**For growth:** Challenge yourself occasionally,
but never at the expense of capturing the moment.
The best photo technique is the one that gets you the shot
while your child is still willing to cooperate.

**Mobile insight:** Your 16,932 mobile photos aren't just "backup snapshots" -
they show intentional focal length choices matching your dedicated camera style
(ultra-wide for drama, 23mm for storytelling, 69mm for portraits).
You're already a multi-focal-length photographer;
any of the four strategies above brings that same versatility
to your dedicated camera with superior image quality.
