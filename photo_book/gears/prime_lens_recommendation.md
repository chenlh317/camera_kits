### 🏛️ Museum Photography Analysis (NEW)

From your **Musée du Louvre** data (668 photos across 2015-2018):

| Year        | 24mm Usage      | 24-35mm Cumulative | Key Pattern                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **2015**    | 53% at 24mm     | 65% at 24-35mm     | Wide + telephoto for details |
| **2016**    | 79% at 24mm     | 87% at 24-41mm     | Strong wide dominance        |
| **2018**    | 90% at 24mm     | 96% at 24-37mm     | Near-exclusive wide-angle    |
| **Overall** | **75% at 24mm** | **85% at 24-41mm** | Wide-angle essential         |

**Museum Photography Insights:**

1. **Wide-angle dominance (75% at 24mm):**
   - Grand gallery interiors require wide coverage
   - Capturing architectural context with artworks
   - Working in crowded spaces with limited movement

2. **Telephoto for details (5% at 50-100mm):**
   - Artwork details when barriers prevent close approach
   - Isolating specific elements from large paintings
   - 85mm perfect for sculpture details and small works

3. **35mm is ideal for museums:**
   - Wider than 50mm for room context
   - Less distortion than 24mm for artwork documentation
   - f/1.8 handles dim gallery lighting without flash
   - Note: If you prefer the dedicated camera for expansive interiors
     (your Louvre data is ~75% at 24mm), a 24mm prime is a solid alternative.
     Otherwise, rely on smartphone ultra-wide to complement 35mm for room coverage.

**Museum-Specific Requirements:**
- ✅ **No flash allowed** → f/1.8 aperture essential
- ✅ **Silent shooting** → Sony's electronic shutter + quiet AF
- ✅ **Low light** → A7C II ISO 3200-6400 + f/1.8 = hand-holdable
- ✅ **Compact size** → Museums often restrict large equipment

### 🥉 **Best Value: 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8** ⭐ NEW CONTENDER

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/16                |
| **Weight**      | ~195g                       |
| **Size**        | 64.5 × 58mm                 |
| **Filter**      | 49mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.29m (1:7.7 magnification) |
| **Price**       | **~\$299**                   |

**Why This is a Game-Changer:**
- ✅ **Exceptional price** — Under \$300, less than half the price of Viltrox, 40% of Sony's price
- ✅ **Lightest 35mm f/1.8** — 195g is 85g lighter than Sony (280g), 145g lighter than Viltrox (340g)
- ✅ **Full f/1.8 aperture** — Same light gathering as Sony, faster than Sigma f/2
- ✅ **Compact design** — Smallest in class, perfect for A7C II's compact philosophy
- ✅ **9-blade circular aperture** — Smooth bokeh rendering
- ✅ **STM autofocus** — Stepping motor for quiet, smooth AF
- ✅ **Multi-mount** — Available for Sony E, Nikon Z, and Leica L mounts

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Sharp center from f/1.8, very good by f/2.8
- ✅ Good build quality for the price
- ⚠️ **STM AF motor** — Quieter than DC motors but not as fast as Sony's linear motor
- ⚠️ **AF-C tracking** — May struggle with erratic kid movement compared to native Sony
- ⚠️ **Weather sealing** — Basic, not as robust as Sony or Sigma
- ⚠️ **Close focus 29cm** — Longer than Sony (22cm) but shorter than Viltrox (40cm)

**Verdict:** The 7Artisans is a remarkable value proposition. At \$299, it's the cheapest
full-frame AF 35mm f/1.8 available and the lightest by a significant margin.
Ideal for budget-conscious users who prioritize weight and don't need the absolute fastest AF
- ⚠️ **Slightly heavier** - 325g vs 280g

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Excellent for events, travel, environmental portraiture
- ⚠️ **Focus breathing** — field of view changes when focusing (less ideal for video)
- ⚠️ Some longitudinal CA at wide apertures
- ⚠️ AF speed and sharpness are very good, but Sony’s native lens typically focuses faster

**Verdict:** If you value build quality and aperture ring,
the Sigma is excellent. The Sony is lighter, sharper, and has native AF advantage.

### **Budget Alternative: Viltrox AF 35mm f/1.8 FE**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~340g        |
| **Filter**      | 55mm         |
| **Close Focus** | ~0.40m       |
| **Price**       | ~\$350-400    |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Half the price** of Sony — significant savings
- ✅ **Fast f/1.8** — Same light gathering as Sony
- ✅ **Punchy rendering** — pleasing micro-contrast
- ⚠️ **Long minimum focus (~40cm)** — longer than Sony (22cm) or Sigma (27cm)
- ⚠️ **AF limitations** — AF-C tracking less reliable than native Sony
- ⚠️ **Aperture ring feel** — stiffer than ideal
- ⚠️ **Weather sealing** — limited or not specified

**Review-Based Note:** "Great optics for the price... 85-90% of Sony at 50% of the cost."
Works well in AF-S mode; check for firmware updates as Viltrox actively improves AF tuning.

**Verdict:** Best value if budget is tight. The 40cm close focus is a real limitation
for environmental portraits. Consider if you need to get close to subjects.

- ✅ **Sharp optics** — very good center sharpness from f/1.8
- ✅ **f/1.8 aperture** — 1/3 stop faster than Evo
- ✅ **Nice bokeh** — 9-blade aperture for smooth backgrounds
- ⚠️ **STM AF motor** — slower and less reliable tracking than VCM or linear motors
- ⚠️ **Heavy** — ~500g is significantly heavier than Sony or Evo

**Verdict:** Only consider if f/1.8 is essential and budget is very tight. The Evo's VCM motor and lighter weight make it a better overall choice for most users.

### **Ultra-Budget: Meike 85mm f/1.8 AF**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~320g        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.85m        |
| **Price**       | ~\$200-250    |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Lowest price** — Entry point to 85mm f/1.8
- ⚠️ **Basic AF** — Functional but not fast
- ⚠️ **Build quality** — Budget tier
- ⚠️ **Optical consistency** — Sample variation possible

**Verdict:** Only if extremely budget-constrained. For kid portraits where AF speed matters, invest in Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo minimum — the VCM motor makes a real difference.

**Recommendation:**
- **Best overall:** Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 — unbeatable AF for kids
- **Best value:** Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo ⭐ — VCM AF, lightest weight (298g), excellent price/performance
- **Budget f/1.8:** Viltrox 85mm f/1.8 II — if you need the extra 1/3 stop
- **Skip:** Ultra-budget Meike unless extremely cost-constrained

**⚠️ Note on Third-Party Lenses (January 2026):**
There was a prior legal issue affecting Viltrox’s Nikon Z-mount lenses;
Sony E-mount lenses are not currently affected. As with any third-party lens, firmware/support can vary by brand.

## 🎒 Complete Prime Kit Strategies

### Strategy A: Premium Sony

**Lenses:**
| Lens               | Use Case                                                    | Price    | Weight |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sony FE 35mm f/1.8 | Night city, indoor events, museums, environmental portraits | \$750-850 | 280g   |
| Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 | Kid portraits, gala headshots, artwork details              | \$600-700 | 371g   |

**Total:** ~\$1,350-1,550 | 651g both primes

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Indoor events: 35mm f/1.8 (group shots, venue ambiance)
- ✅ Night city: 35mm f/1.8 (architecture, street scenes)
- ✅ Kid portraits: 85mm f/1.8 (isolation, bokeh)
- ✅ Mobile 13-23mm covers ultra-wide needs

**Pros:**
- Lightest premium kit
- Fastest AF for kids (native Sony)
- Best low-light (both f/1.8)
- Weather-sealed for travel

**Cons:**
- 35-85mm gap (mobile's 46-69mm helps)
- No ultra-wide on dedicated camera

---

### Strategy B: Budget-Optimized

**Lenses:**
| Lens                   | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sigma 35mm f/2 DG DN   | Night city, indoor events | \$700     | 325g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$1,050-1,100 | 623g both primes

**Coverage:** Same as Strategy A

**Pros:**
- Save ~\$300-450 vs Sony pair
- Sigma's premium metal build
- Viltrox Evo's VCM motor offers near-Sony AF speed
- **Lightest budget kit** — 623g total

**Cons:**
- Both lenses f/2 — 1/3 stop slower than Sony pair
- Third-party firmware/compatibility considerations

---

### Strategy C: Mixed (Best Value + Performance) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Lenses:**
| Lens                   | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sony FE 35mm f/1.8     | Night city, indoor events | \$750-850 | 280g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$1,100-1,250 | **578g** both primes (lightest recommended kit!)

**Rationale:**
- 35mm used more often → invest in Sony for best AF speed
- 85mm for portrait sessions → Viltrox Evo's VCM motor offers excellent AF at half the price
- **Best balance of price, performance, and weight**
- Lighter than full Sony kit (578g vs 651g)

---

### Strategy D: Ultra-Budget (NEW) 🆕

**Lenses:**
| Lens                    | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8 | Night city, indoor events | \$299     | 195g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo  | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$650-700 | **493g** both primes (**lightest & cheapest kit!**)

**Rationale:**
- 7Artisans at \$299 is less than half the cost of any other 35mm f/1.8
- At 195g, it's the lightest 35mm f/1.8 available (85g lighter than Sony)
- Combined kit under \$700 = less than a single Sony 35mm f/1.8
- Full f/1.8 aperture for low-light performance

**Pros:**
- **Extreme value** — complete two-prime kit for under \$700
- **Ultra-light** — 493g total, 85g lighter than Strategy C
- Both lenses have full f/1.8/f/2.0 apertures for low-light

**Cons:**
- STM AF on 7Artisans — not as fast as Sony's linear motor for kid tracking
- Basic weather sealing on 7Artisans
- Third-party firmware/compatibility considerations
- Less robust build quality than premium options

**Best for:** Budget-conscious users, travel-focused photographers prioritizing weight,
or as a "try before you invest" kit to validate the focal length choices.

## 🌙 Low-Light Performance Analysis

### Your Use Cases: How f/1.8 Helps

**Indoor Gala Night Scenario:**
| Setting         | f/4 Zoom          | f/1.8 Prime      | Advantage       |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Typical venue   | ISO 12800, 1/60s  | ISO 3200, 1/60s  | 2 stops cleaner |
| Dance floor     | ISO 25600, 1/125s | ISO 6400, 1/125s | 2 stops cleaner |
| Candlelit table | ISO 25600, 1/30s  | ISO 6400, 1/30s  | Usable vs noisy |

**Night City Sightseeing:**
| Scenario     | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Blue hour    | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | Maximum quality |
| Night street | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | 2 stops cleaner |
| Indoor cafe  | ISO 3200        | ISO 800         | Minimal noise   |

**🏛️ Museum Gallery (NEW):**
| Scenario                  | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Bright gallery            | ISO 1600        | ISO 400         | Maximum detail  |
| Dim Old Masters room      | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | 2 stops cleaner |
| Sculpture hall            | ISO 3200        | ISO 800         | Clean shadows   |
| Louvre Pyramid (interior) | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | Best quality    |

**Museum-Specific Advantages of f/1.8:**
- **No flash required** - Most museums prohibit flash photography
- **Silent shooting** - A7C II electronic shutter + quiet prime AF
- **Compact gear** - Museums may restrict professional-looking equipment
- **Natural colors** - Avoid flash washing out artwork colors

**A7C II + f/1.8 = No-Flash Photography**

The A7C II has excellent high-ISO performance up to ISO 6400 with acceptable noise. Combined with:
- f/1.8 aperture (4× light vs f/4)
- 5-axis IBIS rated up to ~7 stops (CIPA, lens/body dependent)
- Fast eye-AF (works in low EV)

You can shoot almost any indoor event or museum without flash, preserving natural ambiance.

---

## 📐 Why NOT Other Focal Lengths

### ❌ 20mm Prime
- **Your mobile (Samsung S25):** Already shoots 13mm ultra-wide excellently
- **Usage data:** Only 6-8% of shots at ultra-wide
- **Indoor events:** Too wide, distorts faces at edges
- **Verdict:** Mobile covers this; don't duplicate

### ❌ 24mm Prime
- **Close to mobile:** S25 shoots ~23mm — nearly identical field of view
- **If you need wider than mobile:** consider 20mm
- **Indoor limitation:** Similar issues as 20mm for portraits
- **Verdict:** Often redundant with your smartphone for interiors;
  still worthwhile if you prefer higher IQ on the dedicated camera

### ❌ 40mm Prime
- **"Tweener" focal length:** Neither wide nor portrait
- **Limited options:** Fewer choices, often slower (f/2.5)
- **Your data:** No strong clustering at 40mm in archives
- **Verdict:** 35mm more versatile

### ❌ 50mm Prime
- **Too close to 35mm:** Only 15mm difference
- **Not enough for portraits:** 50mm less flattering than 85mm for faces
- **Your data:** 50mm usage lower than 35mm and 85mm peaks
- **Verdict:** Creates awkward coverage with 35mm or 85mm

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### For Your Specific Use Cases:

**"Portrait for kids, night/low-light city sightseeing, indoor events like a gala night, museums"**

#### 🥇 If AF Speed is Critical (Kids Photography Priority):
**Buy: Sony FE 35mm f/1.8** (~\$750-850)

**Why:**
1. **Kids:** Fastest, most reliable eye-AF for tracking unpredictable children
2. **Night city:** f/1.8 + IBIS = handheld shots at ISO 1600-3200
3. **Gala events:** No-flash indoor photography, natural ambiance
4. **Museums:** Silent AF + no flash + compact = perfect gallery companion
5. **Weight:** Very light (280g) complements compact A7C II
6. **Quality:** Native Sony = best compatibility, fastest AF

#### 🥈 If Budget & Weight are Critical: ⭐ NEW RECOMMENDATION
**Buy: 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8** (~\$299)

**Why:**
1. **Price:** At \$299, it's 60% cheaper than Sony — savings can fund the 85mm lens
2. **Weight:** Lightest in class at 195g (85g lighter than Sony!)
3. **Performance:** Full f/1.8 aperture for identical low-light capability
4. **Compact:** Perfect match for A7C II's compact philosophy
5. **Trade-off:** STM AF is adequate for most use cases, just not as fast as Sony for erratic kid movement
