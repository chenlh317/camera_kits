**Critical Finding:** For city/night photography, you consistently shoot **70-85% at 23-27mm**.
A 35mm prime hits the sweet spot between your 23-27mm mobile coverage and your portrait needs.

### 🏛️ Museum Photography Analysis (NEW)

From your **Musée du Louvre** data (668 photos across 2015-2018):

| Year        | 24mm Usage      | 24-35mm Cumulative | Key Pattern                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **2015**    | 53% at 24mm     | 65% at 24-35mm     | Wide + telephoto for details |
| **2016**    | 79% at 24mm     | 87% at 24-41mm     | Strong wide dominance        |
| **2018**    | 90% at 24mm     | 96% at 24-37mm     | Near-exclusive wide-angle    |
| **Overall** | **75% at 24mm** | **85% at 24-41mm** | Wide-angle essential         |

**Museum Photography Insights:**

1. **Wide-angle dominance (75% at 24mm):**
   - Grand gallery interiors require wide coverage
   - Capturing architectural context with artworks
   - Working in crowded spaces with limited movement

2. **Telephoto for details (5% at 50-100mm):**
   - Artwork details when barriers prevent close approach
   - Isolating specific elements from large paintings
   - 85mm perfect for sculpture details and small works

3. **35mm is ideal for museums:**
   - Wider than 50mm for room context
   - Less distortion than 24mm for artwork documentation
   - f/1.8 handles dim gallery lighting without flash
   - Note: If you prefer the dedicated camera for expansive interiors
     (your Louvre data is ~75% at 24mm), a 24mm prime is a solid alternative.
     Otherwise, rely on smartphone ultra-wide to complement 35mm for room coverage.

**Museum-Specific Requirements:**
- ✅ **No flash allowed** → f/1.8 aperture essential
- ✅ **Silent shooting** → Sony's electronic shutter + quiet AF
- ✅ **Low light** → A7C II ISO 3200-6400 + f/1.8 = hand-holdable
- ✅ **Compact size** → Museums often restrict large equipment

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22                |
| **Weight**      | 280g                        |
| **Size**        | 65.6 × 73mm                 |
| **Filter**      | 55mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.22m (0.24× magnification) |
| **Price**       | ~\$750-850                  |

**Why This Lens:**
- ✅ **One of the lightest full-frame 35mm f/1.8** - perfect for A7C II compact philosophy
- ✅ **Exceptional low-light** - f/1.8 is 4× faster than f/4 zooms
- ✅ **Native Sony AF** - fastest, most reliable eye-AF for kid tracking
- ✅ **Weather-sealed** - dust and moisture resistant for travel
- ✅ **Close focus 0.22m** - capture kid details up close

**Low-Light Performance (Your Use Cases):**
- Indoor gala at ISO 3200, f/1.8: ~1/60s (hand-holdable)
- Night city with IBIS, f/1.8: ISO 1600-3200 sufficient
- Museum gallery, f/1.8: ISO 1600-3200 (no flash needed)
- A7C II's excellent high-ISO + f/1.8 = no flash needed indoors

**Optical Characteristics:**
- Sharp from f/1.8 center, excellent by f/2.8 corners
- Minimal distortion (auto-corrected in-camera)
- Pleasant bokeh for environmental portraits
- Good flare resistance

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Chromatic aberration (purple/green fringing) can appear in high-contrast backlit scenes
- ⚠️ Some vignetting wide open (correctable in-camera/post)
- ⚠️ Coma at widest apertures — not ideal for astrophotography

### 🥈 **Budget Pick: Sigma 35mm f/2 DG DN Contemporary (I Series)**

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/2 - f/22                  |
| **Weight**      | 325g                        |
| **Size**        | 70 × 67.4mm                 |
| **Filter**      | 58mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.27m (1:5.7 magnification) |
| **Price**       | ~\$700                      |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Premium build** - All-metal construction, magnetic lens cap
- ✅ **Manual aperture ring** - Tactile control for video/photo
- ✅ **Dust/splash resistant** - Rubber-sealed mount
- ✅ **Smooth bokeh** - Reviewers note "slightly smoother" than Sony
- ⚠️ **f/2 vs f/1.8** - 1/3 stop slower (minor difference)

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Excellent for events, travel, environmental portraiture
- ⚠️ **Focus breathing** — field of view changes when focusing (less ideal for video)
- ⚠️ Some longitudinal CA at wide apertures
- ⚠️ AF speed and sharpness are very good, but Sony's native lens typically focuses faster

**Verdict:** If you value build quality and aperture ring,
the Sigma is excellent. The Sony is lighter, sharper, and has native AF advantage.

### 🥉 **Best Value: 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8** ⭐ NEW CONTENDER

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/16                |
| **Weight**      | 426g                        |
| **Size**        | 64.5 × 58mm                 |
| **Filter**      | 49mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.29m (1:7.7 magnification) |
| **Price**       | **~\$299**                  |

**Why This is a Game-Changer:**
- ✅ **Exceptional price** — Under \$300, ~15% cheaper than Viltrox, ~40% of Sony's price
- ✅ **Full f/1.8 aperture** — Same light gathering as Sony, faster than Sigma f/2
- ✅ **Compact design** — Perfect for A7C II's compact philosophy
- ✅ **9-blade circular aperture** — Smooth bokeh rendering
- ✅ **STM autofocus** — Stepping motor for quiet, smooth AF
- ✅ **Multi-mount** — Available for Sony E, Nikon Z, and Leica L mounts

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Sharp center from f/1.8, very good by f/2.8
- ✅ Good build quality for the price
- ⚠️ **STM AF motor** — Quieter than DC motors but not as fast as Sony's linear motor
- ⚠️ **AF-C tracking** — May struggle with erratic kid movement compared to native Sony
- ⚠️ **Weather sealing** — Basic, not as robust as Sony or Sigma
- ⚠️ **Close focus 29cm** — Longer than Sony (22cm) but shorter than Viltrox (40cm)

**Verdict:** The 7Artisans is a remarkable value proposition. At \$299, it's the cheapest
full-frame AF 35mm f/1.8 available. At 426g, it's heavier than the Sony (280g) but still
ideal for budget-conscious users who prioritize value over weight and don't need the absolute fastest AF.

### **Fast Aperture Option: SIRUI AURORA 35mm F1.4** 🆕 NEW

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.4 - f/16                |
| **Weight**      | ~480g                       |
| **Size**        | ~80 × 90mm                  |
| **Filter**      | 67mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | ~0.35m                      |
| **Price**       | **~\$549-599**              |

**Why This is Interesting:**
- ✅ **Fastest aperture in class** — f/1.4 is 2/3 stop faster than f/1.8 options
- ✅ **15 rounded aperture blades** — most in class, exceptional bokeh circles
- ✅ **Weather sealed** — dust/splash proof with fluorine coating on front element
- ✅ **USB-C port** — firmware updates for future improvements
- ✅ **Declickable aperture ring** — smooth transitions for video work
- ✅ **Custom function button** — assignable via camera
- ✅ **Multi-mount** — Sony E, Nikon Z, Fuji X, L-mount

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ Beautiful, creamy bokeh — strength of the Aurora series
- ✅ Good sharpness at portrait distances (2.5-5m)
- ⚠️ **STM AF motor** — quieter but not as fast as Sony's linear motor
- ⚠️ **Heavier** — 480g vs Sony 280g, 7Artisans 426g
- ⚠️ **Focus breathing** — noticeable but not unusually so for 35mm
- ⚠️ **Sharpness at infinity** — optimized for portraits, less sharp at landscape distances

**When to Choose SIRUI over Others:**
- Low-light is critical (f/1.4 = 2/3 stop advantage)
- Bokeh quality is priority (15 blades = exceptional circles)
- Video work (declickable aperture, quiet AF)
- Budget f/1.4 (Sony 35mm f/1.4 GM costs ~\$1,400)

**Verdict:** The SIRUI Aurora 35mm F1.4 offers the fastest aperture in this comparison at a reasonable price.
At ~\$550-600, it costs less than Sony's f/1.8 while offering f/1.4. The 15-blade aperture delivers
exceptional bokeh. Trade-offs: heavier than f/1.8 options and STM AF is adequate but not fastest tier.

---

### **Budget Alternative: Viltrox AF 35mm f/1.8 FE**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~340g        |
| **Filter**      | 55mm         |
| **Close Focus** | ~0.40m       |
| **Price**       | ~\$350-400   |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Half the price** of Sony — significant savings
- ✅ **Fast f/1.8** — Same light gathering as Sony
- ✅ **Punchy rendering** — pleasing micro-contrast
- ⚠️ **Long minimum focus (~40cm)** — longer than Sony (22cm) or Sigma (27cm)
- ⚠️ **AF limitations** — AF-C tracking less reliable than native Sony
- ⚠️ **Aperture ring feel** — stiffer than ideal
- ⚠️ **Weather sealing** — limited or not specified

**Review-Based Note:** "Great optics for the price... 85-90% of Sony at 50% of the cost."
Works well in AF-S mode; check for firmware updates as Viltrox actively improves AF tuning.

**Verdict:** Best value if budget is tight. The 40cm close focus is a real limitation
for environmental portraits. Consider if you need to get close to subjects.

### **Best Value: Viltrox AF 85mm f/2.0 Evo** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

| Specification   | Value                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Aperture**    | f/2.0 - f/16                |
| **Weight**      | 298g                        |
| **Size**        | 66 × 75mm                   |
| **Filter**      | 62mm                        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.85m (0.11× magnification) |
| **Price**       | ~\$350-400                  |

**Why This is the Best Value Pick:**
- ✅ **VCM autofocus motor** — Voice Coil Motor for fast, silent, precise AF (major upgrade over STM)
- ✅ **Lightest 85mm option** — 298g vs Sony's 371g (73g lighter!)
- ✅ **Compact design** — smaller than Sony, fits the A7C II compact philosophy
- ✅ **Sharp optics** — excellent center sharpness from f/2.0, very sharp by f/2.8
- ✅ **Half the price of Sony** — significant savings at \$350-400
- ✅ **9-blade circular aperture** — smooth, pleasing bokeh
- ✅ **Weather-resistant** — dust and moisture resistant design

**Optical Characteristics:**
- 11 elements in 8 groups with ED and HR elements
- Minimal chromatic aberration for the price point
- Low focus breathing — good for video work
- Smooth manual focus ring with de-clicked aperture option

**Review-Based Considerations:**
- ✅ VCM AF significantly faster than older STM Viltrox lenses
- ✅ Eye-AF tracking works well for portraits
- ⚠️ **f/2.0 vs f/1.8** — 1/3 stop slower (minor in practice)
- ⚠️ Third-party lens — potential firmware compatibility considerations

**Why Evo Over Viltrox 85mm f/1.8 II:**
- VCM motor vs STM = faster, quieter AF
- 298g vs ~500g = 200g lighter
- Better suited for A7C II's compact, lightweight philosophy
- Newer optical design with improved coatings

**Verdict:** Best balance of price, weight, and AF performance. The VCM motor brings autofocus speed much closer to Sony's linear motor at half the price. Ideal for kid portraits where you want fast AF without breaking the bank.

### 🥉 **Budget f/1.8: Viltrox 85mm f/1.8 II STM**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/16 |
| **Weight**      | ~500g        |
| **Filter**      | 72mm         |
| **Close Focus** | ~0.85m       |
| **Price**       | ~\$300-350   |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Lowest Viltrox price** — even cheaper than the Evo
- ✅ **Sharp optics** — very good center sharpness from f/1.8
- ✅ **f/1.8 aperture** — 1/3 stop faster than Evo
- ✅ **Nice bokeh** — 9-blade aperture for smooth backgrounds
- ⚠️ **STM AF motor** — slower and less reliable tracking than VCM or linear motors
- ⚠️ **Heavy** — ~500g is significantly heavier than Sony or Evo

**Verdict:** Only consider if f/1.8 is essential and budget is very tight. The Evo's VCM motor and lighter weight make it a better overall choice for most users.

---

### **Ultra-Budget: Meike 85mm f/1.8 AF**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~320g        |
| **Close Focus** | 0.85m        |
| **Price**       | ~\$200-250   |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Lowest price** — Entry point to 85mm f/1.8
- ⚠️ **Basic AF** — Functional but not fast
- ⚠️ **Build quality** — Budget tier
- ⚠️ **Optical consistency** — Sample variation possible

**Verdict:** Only if extremely budget-constrained. For kid portraits where AF speed matters, invest in Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo minimum — the VCM motor makes a real difference.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Sigma 35mm f/2 DG DN   | Night city, indoor events | \$700     | 325g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$1,050-1,100 | 623g both primes

**Coverage:** Same as Strategy A

**Pros:**
- Save ~\$300-450 vs Sony pair

| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Sony FE 35mm f/1.8     | Night city, indoor events | \$750-850 | 280g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$1,100-1,250 | **578g** both primes (lightest recommended kit!)

**Rationale:**

| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8 | Night city, indoor events | \$299     | 426g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo  | Kid portraits (VCM AF)    | \$350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~\$650-700 | **724g** both primes (**cheapest kit!**)

**Rationale:**
- 7Artisans at \$299 is less than half the cost of any other 35mm f/1.8

### Strategy E: Best Low-Light (NEW) 🌙

**Lenses:**
| Lens                           | Use Case                    | Price     | Weight |

## 🌙 Low-Light Performance Analysis

### Your Use Cases: How Fast Apertures Help

**Indoor Gala Night Scenario:**
| Setting         | f/4 Zoom          | f/1.8 Prime      | f/1.4 Prime 🆕   | Advantage            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Typical venue   | ISO 12800, 1/60s  | ISO 3200, 1/60s  | ISO 2000, 1/60s  | 2-2.7 stops cleaner  |
| Dance floor     | ISO 25600, 1/125s | ISO 6400, 1/125s | ISO 4000, 1/125s | 2-2.7 stops cleaner  |
| Candlelit table | ISO 25600, 1/30s  | ISO 6400, 1/30s  | ISO 4000, 1/30s  | f/1.4 = most usable  |

**Night City Sightseeing:**
| Scenario     | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | f/1.4 Prime 🆕  | Advantage            |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Blue hour    | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | ISO 125         | Maximum quality      |
| Night street | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | ISO 1000, 1/60s | 2-2.7 stops cleaner  |
| Indoor cafe  | ISO 3200        | ISO 800         | ISO 500         | Minimal noise        |

**🏛️ Museum Gallery (NEW):**
| Scenario                  | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | f/1.4 Prime 🆕  | Advantage            |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Bright gallery            | ISO 1600        | ISO 400         | ISO 250         | Maximum detail       |

| Louvre Pyramid (interior) | ISO 800         | ISO 200         | ISO 125         | Best quality         |

> 🌙 **SIRUI Aurora f/1.4 Advantage:** The 2/3 stop advantage of f/1.4 over f/1.8 means ~60% lower ISO
> in the same conditions. This translates to noticeably cleaner images in the darkest gala venues
> and museum galleries.

**Museum-Specific Advantages of Fast Primes:**
- **No flash required** - Most museums prohibit flash photography
- **Silent shooting** - A7C II electronic shutter + quiet prime AF
- **Compact gear** - Museums may restrict professional-looking equipment
- **Natural colors** - Avoid flash washing out artwork colors

**A7C II + f/1.8 or f/1.4 = No-Flash Photography**

The A7C II has excellent high-ISO performance up to ISO 6400 with acceptable noise. Combined with:
- f/1.8 aperture (4× light vs f/4) or f/1.4 (5.7× light vs f/4)
- 5-axis IBIS rated up to ~7 stops (CIPA, lens/body dependent)
- Fast eye-AF (works in low EV)

You can shoot almost any indoor event or museum without flash, preserving natural ambiance.

---

## 📐 Why NOT Other Focal Lengths

### ❌ 20mm Prime
- **Your mobile (Samsung S25):** Already shoots 13mm ultra-wide excellently
- **Usage data:** Only 6-8% of shots at ultra-wide
- **Indoor events:** Too wide, distorts faces at edges
- **Verdict:** Mobile covers this; don't duplicate

### ❌ 24mm Prime
- **Close to mobile:** S25 shoots ~23mm — nearly identical field of view
- **If you need wider than mobile:** consider 20mm
- **Indoor limitation:** Similar issues as 20mm for portraits
- **Verdict:** Often redundant with your smartphone for interiors;
  still worthwhile if you prefer higher IQ on the dedicated camera

### ❌ 40mm Prime
- **"Tweener" focal length:** Neither wide nor portrait
- **Limited options:** Fewer choices, often slower (f/2.5)
- **Your data:** No strong clustering at 40mm in archives
- **Verdict:** 35mm more versatile

### ❌ 50mm Prime
- **Too close to 35mm:** Only 15mm difference
- **Not enough for portraits:** 50mm less flattering than 85mm for faces
- **Your data:** 50mm usage lower than 35mm and 85mm peaks
- **Verdict:** Creates awkward coverage with 35mm or 85mm

4. **Museums:** Silent AF + no flash + compact = perfect gallery companion
5. **Weight:** Very light (280g) complements compact A7C II
6. **Quality:** Native Sony = best compatibility, fastest AF

#### 🥈 If Budget & Weight are Critical: ⭐ NEW RECOMMENDATION
**Buy: 7Artisans AF 35mm f/1.8** (~\$299)

**Why:**
1. **Price:** At \$299, it's 60% cheaper than Sony — savings can fund the 85mm lens
2. **Performance:** Full f/1.8 aperture for identical low-light capability
3. **Compact:** Reasonably compact design
4. **Trade-off:** STM AF is adequate for most use cases, just not as fast as Sony for erratic kid movement
5. **Trade-off:** Heavier than Sony (426g vs 280g)

#### 🥉 If Low-Light & Bokeh are Critical: 🌙 NEW
**Buy: SIRUI Aurora 35mm f/1.4** (~\$549-599)

**Why:**
1. **Fastest aperture:** f/1.4 is 2/3 stop faster than f/1.8 — more light in dark venues
2. **Best bokeh:** 15 rounded aperture blades produce exceptional bokeh circles
3. **Budget f/1.4:** Less than Sony's f/1.8 price, with faster aperture
4. **Weather sealed:** Dust/splash proof for travel
5. **Trade-off:** STM AF is adequate but not fastest tier for kid tracking
