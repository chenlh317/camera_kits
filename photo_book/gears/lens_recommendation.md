### 🎯 Top Gear Recommendations

**Three Top Lens Strategies (Plus One Alternative - Choose Based on Your Priorities):**

---

**🥇 Option 1A: Sony SEL2070G (FE 20-70mm f/4 G)** - ~$1,100 | **Best Quality in Primary Zone**

**Why this lens:**
- **Covers your sweet spot:** 20-35mm is where you shoot most (65-80% of all travel photos)
- **Wider than ever before:** 20mm breaks your historical 24mm constraint
- **G-series optical excellence:** Superior sharpness in your 85-90% usage zone (20–70mm)
- **Perfect ecosystem fit:** Mobile (13mm ultra-wide) → SEL2070G (20–70mm)
  → 85mm prime (portraits) → HX90 (telephoto backup)

For comparisons vs 24–70 f/4, 16–35 f/4, and 24–70 f/2.8,
see [Why SEL2070G Over Alternatives](why-sel2070g-over-alternatives).

**Choose this if:** Optical quality in 20–70mm is paramount;
you're okay keeping HX90 as telephoto backup.

> 💡 **Note:** Options 1A and 1C have the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~$1,100).
> The only difference is your future plan: 1A keeps HX90 long-term,
> while 1C plans to add Tamron superzoom when a safari/wildlife trip is booked.

---

**🥇 Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN Contemporary** - ~$900-1,100 | **Best Kit Simplification**

**Why this lens:**
- **Same 20mm wide end:** Breaks your 24mm constraint (matches SEL2070G)
- **Full-frame 70-200mm quality:** Massive upgrade over HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor at telephoto
- **Retire the HX90:** Simplify to 2 devices instead of 3
- **Skip future 70-200mm investment:** Complete coverage now, no additional lens needed later

**⚠️ Important Trade-offs (per LensTip review):**
Severe 20mm moustache distortion (-8.55%) and tele pincushion at 200mm (+3.21%)
(see [LensTip Distortion chapter](https://www.lenstip.com/716.6-Lens_review-Sigma_C_20-200_mm_f_3.5-6.3_DG_Distortion_and_field_of_view.html));
dramatic vignetting at 20mm f/3.5 on full frame (~81%, -4.81 EV)
(see [LensTip Vignetting chapter](https://www.lenstip.com/716.8-Lens_review-Sigma_C_20-200_mm_f_3.5-6.3_DG_Vignetting.html));
edges soften at 200mm.

**Choose this if:** You want to retire HX90 immediately;
kit simplification matters; you accept the optical compromises

---

**🌟 Option 1C: Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy** - ~$1,100 now + ~$1,000-1,300 later | **Staged Investment**

**Why this strategy:**
- **Buy SEL2070G now:** G-series quality for 95%+ of city trips where 70mm is sufficient
- **Buy Tamron 25-200mm later:** Only when safari/wildlife trip is actually planned
- **No optical compromises:** Avoid Sigma's distortion issues entirely
- **Defer superzoom cost:** May not need it for years—or ever

**Choose this if:** Most trips are city travel;
safari/wildlife trips are planned events;
you prefer buying the right tool when actually needed

**Camera Body: Sony A7C II or A7 IV** - ~$2,200-2,500

**Why these bodies:**
- **33MP sweet spot:** Perfect resolution balance - high quality without overkill file sizes
- **Excellent high-ISO:** Clean ISO 6400 compensates for f/4 lens in low light
- **AI autofocus:** Reliable tracking for children on the move
- **Travel-optimized:** IBIS, weather sealing, vari-angle screen; A7 IV adds dual card slots

**Choose A7C II if:** Lightest weight (514g) and smallest size are priorities
for travel with child

**Choose A7 IV if:** You prefer traditional DSLR-style grip
and more substantial feel (658g, better ergonomics)

**Important:** Both cameras share the same 33MP sensor, but AF/handling and feature details differ.
Main difference is ergonomics vs portability; A7C II is more compact, while A7 IV offers a larger grip and dual card slots.
Try both in person before deciding - grip comfort is highly subjective.

### 📊 Key Findings from Your Data

**Your Shooting Evolution (2004-2025):**
- **Early years (2004-2009):** 35-50mm normal lens era
- **Transition (2012-2016):** 24mm wide-angle revolution (50-75% at 24mm)
- **Recent years (2017-2025):** 23-27mm ultra-wide dominance (65-80% of shots)

**Mobile Phone Integration (15,528 photos, 2006-2026):**
- **75% shot at 23-29mm** - mirrors your 24mm dedication on dedicated cameras
- **28% of total photography** - mobile is now a primary camera, not backup
- **Samsung S25 usage:** 64% at 23mm, 15% at 69mm (3x tele), 8% at 13mm (ultra-wide)

**What You Don't Need:**
- ❌ **Dedicated 70-200mm telephoto zoom** - the recommended 85mm prime covers portraits;
  consider Sigma 20–200mm or Tamron 25–200mm superzoom
  to replace HX90 with full-frame quality
- ❌ **Ultra-wide zoom (10-18mm)** - Mobile phone 13mm handles this superbly
- ❌ **24-105mm** - Dead zone at 50-70mm,
  doesn't go wide enough (24mm still limiting)

**NEW Alternative:** Consider **Sigma 20–200mm f/3.5–6.3 DG DN Contemporary**
or **Tamron 25–200mm f/2.8–5.6 Di III VXD G2** superzooms

## Your Current/Planned Gear Context

- 🔍 **85mm f/1.8 prime** - Recommended for portraits (~$550-600)
- ✅ **Sony HX90** (24–720mm equivalent) - Auxiliary camera for telephoto needs
- ✅ **Mobile phones** - 13mm/23mm/27mm ultra-wide and wide angles
- 🔍 **Main zoom lens** - To be determined (this recommendation)

**Implication:** Your main dedicated camera lens should focus on the **20–70mm range**
(or 20-200mm for kit simplification),
since ultra-wide needs (13-18mm) are well-served by your mobile phone,
portraits will be covered by the recommended 85mm f/1.8 prime,
and super-telephoto (100-720mm) is handled by the HX90 backup camera.

- **2019-2023:** Multi-camera phones - intentional focal length choices
- **2023-2026:** Mobile as creative tool (ultra-wide, telephoto, multiple focal lengths)

**Key Mobile Insight:**

Your mobile phone is NOT just a backup - it's a deliberate creative choice:
- When you want 13mm ultra-wide drama
- When you want 23-27mm convenience
- When you want 69mm telephoto without changing lenses
- When you want to travel light with your child

**Impact on Lens Recommendation:**

With 75% of mobile shots at 23-29mm and 8% at 13mm ultra-wide,
your mobile ALREADY covers:
- Ultra-wide storytelling (13mm)
- Standard wide-angle (23-27mm)
- Modest telephoto (69mm)

This makes 20–70mm dedicated lens even MORE logical -
it fills the quality gap without duplicating mobile convenience.

- **100-day photos (Mar 2022):** Median 33mm, most used 33mm (34%) and 24mm (26%)
- **Half-year photos (May 2022):** Median 42mm, most used 67mm (14%) and 52-75mm (12-13% each)
- Pattern: Mixed focal length usage with telephoto
  for flattering portraits (67-75mm) and wider angles (24-45mm) for environmental baby shots

**Budapest 2016 (Portrait-Focused Trip):**

- High 75mm usage (100% of main camera shots - 124 photos)
- **Context:** Using SAL1650 on Sony A550 (16-50mm, ~24-75mm equiv)
- **Reason:** 75mm was the telephoto end of available lens
  during dedicated portrait session
- **Not representative of general travel** - specialized portrait work, not typical shooting

**Landscape Travel (Most trips):**

- Absolute dominance: 23-24mm wide angle
- 60-80% of all shots in ultra-wide to wide range

**Museum/Gallery Photography (Musée du Louvre 2015-2018):**

- **668 photos** across 5 visits with focal length data
- **74.85% at 24mm** - extreme wide-angle dominance in indoor museum settings
- **Median: 24mm, Mean: 38mm** - even more wide-angle focused than outdoor travel
- **2018 visit (244 photos):** 90.16% at 24mm - most concentrated wide-angle usage
- **2016 visit (218 photos):** 78.90% at 24mm
- **Pattern:** Indoor museum/gallery photography is almost exclusively wide-angle
  - Capturing full artworks and architectural context
  - Limited space for backing up = ultra-wide necessity
  - Telephoto virtually unused (<5% beyond 50mm)
- **Implication:** SEL2070G's 20mm wide end is IDEAL for museum visits;
  confirms your wide-angle preference extends to all photography contexts

  - 67% of HX90 shots at 24mm - even backup camera used wide
- **Czech Republic 2013 (Prague):** 70% at 24mm, mean 30mm
  - Highest 24mm concentration in entire dataset
  - Historic architecture and narrow streets = ultra-wide necessity
- **Japan 2024 (Recent trip):** Similar 45-50% at 24mm pattern
  - Consistency across 6-year gap validates urban wide-angle preference

**Nordic Landscapes (Svalbard, Lofoten, Norway):**

- **Svalbard 2015 (Arctic):** Mean 233mm on HX90 (telescopic distant subjects)
  - 43% at 24mm on HX90 (landscapes)
  - 21-22% at 75mm on main camera (distant wildlife, icebergs)
  - Combination of vast landscapes (wide) + distant subjects (telephoto)
- **Lofoten 2015:** 34% at 24mm + 35% at 29mm (iPhone), mean 36mm
  - More balanced focal length distribution
  - 23% at 75mm for dramatic landscape compression
  - Telephoto usage 2-3x higher than typical travel
- **Pattern:** Open landscapes create opportunity for telephoto compression
  - BUT still 60-70% in wide-angle range overall

**Mediterranean/Cultural Travel (Tunisia, Turkey, Balkans):**

- **Tunisia 2013:** 83% at 35mm (iPhone 4S convenience)
  - Low dedicated camera usage - relied on mobile phone
  - Travel style: Less photography-focused, more experiential
- **Turkey 2014:** Diverse range with strong 24mm core

**SAGA Norway & Iceland 2014-2015 (14-day winter expedition):**

- **2,426 photos across 14 days (Dec 28 - Jan 9)** - per folder analysis
- **New Year's Eve alone (12/31):** 324 photos, 60% at 24mm, 17% at 75mm
  - Highest volume shooting day shows your natural wide-angle preference
- **Overall trip pattern:** 39% at 24mm + 12% at 75mm + 12% at 33mm + 7% at 105mm
  - Extended Arctic trip showed most diverse focal length usage of any trip
  - Wide variety due to: landscapes (24mm), aurora (24mm), distant subjects (105mm), portraits (75mm)
- **Arctic winter landscapes:** Primarily wide-angle for vast scenery,
  with telephoto for distant landscape features and northern lights

**Key Insights:**

- **Urban = 65-75% ultra-wide** (24mm constraint, likely want even wider)
- **Landscapes = 55-70% wide-angle** + 15-25% telephoto compression
- **Casual travel = mobile convenience** (23-35mm single focal length)
- **Photography-focused trips = more focal length diversity** (but still 60%+ wide)

**Implication for Lens Choice:**

- SEL2070G's 20mm wide end serves dense urban environments perfectly
- 70mm covers initial landscape compression before 85mm prime
- Wider than 24mm = unlock better compositions in tight spaces

- **Insight:** Even with the SAME landscape, you shoot wider (24mm) than companions (29-33mm)

**Tunisia 2013: Photographer Style Comparison**

- **"Tunisia Pics" subfolder:** 28 photos, 43% at 27mm, diverse range to 72mm
  - Someone else's compact camera (likely travel companion)
  - More telephoto usage (14% at 42mm, 7% at 72mm)
- **Your mobile:** 140 photos, 100% at 35mm (iPhone 4S)
- **Pattern:** Companions explore focal lengths; you stick to proven wide

**Czech Republic 2013: Personal Style**

- **Your photos (root):** 750 photos, 72% at 24mm
- **"Patty" subfolder:** 112 photos without EXIF (companion's photos?)
- **Your "Selected":** 100 photos, 84% at 24mm
- **Clear signature:** 24mm is YOUR voice, regardless of destination

**SAGA Norway & Iceland 2014-2015: Solo Shooting**

- **No companion folders** - entirely your vision
- **2,426 photos across 14-day Arctic expedition**
- **Pattern:** 39% at 24mm overall, with individual high-volume days reaching 60% at 24mm
- **Most diverse trip:** 12% at 75mm, 12% at 33mm, 7% at 105mm shows focal length variety when time allows

**Key Insights:**

1. **Your 24mm preference is PERSONAL STYLE, not situational**
   - Same destinations, different photographers = different focal lengths
   - You consistently choose wider than companions
2. **Companions shoot 29-35mm; you shoot 24mm**
   - Given the same scenes, you frame wider
   - This validates wanting even wider (20mm SEL2070G)
3. **Your consistency = photographic voice**
   - Not indecision or limitation
   - Deliberate aesthetic choice honed over 21 years
4. **Companion photos often LACK your wide-angle signature**
   - Their 35mm normal perspective vs your 24mm environmental style
   - Your wide-angle storytelling is what makes your photos YOURS

**Bottom Line:**

Your 65-80% wide-angle usage isn't because:

- ❌ "That's all you had" (companions had same gear, shot differently)
- ❌ "That's what the destination required" (same locations, different choices)
- ❌ "You don't know better" (21 years of consistent evolution)

**It's because:**

- ✅ **Wide-angle is your photographic voice**
- ✅ **Environmental storytelling is your strength**
- ✅ **23-27mm is YOUR signature perspective**

**SEL2070G's 20mm start honors this while giving you MORE of what you love.**

### ⭐ **Option 1C: Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy (SEL2070G Now + Superzoom Later)**

> 💡 **Note:** Option 1C has the **same initial purchase as Option 1A** (SEL2070G ~$1,100).
> The difference is purely in your future telephoto strategy.
> You can start with SEL2070G and decide later which path to take.

**This approach addresses concerns about superzoom optical compromises while maintaining future flexibility:**

(the-core-insight)=
#### The Core Insight

Your trip patterns are **predictable by type**:
- **City trips (Asia, Europe, etc.):** 95%+ of your travel — telephoto rarely needed
- **Safari/wildlife/sports trips:** Occasional and planned well in advance — telephoto essential
- **Mixed trips:** Rare, and HX90 can bridge unexpected telephoto needs

**Why buy a compromised superzoom now
if you might not need it for years?**

(the-strategy)=
#### The Strategy

**Phase 1: Buy SEL2070G Now (~$1,100)**
- Covers 95%+ of your city travel photography needs.
- G-series optical excellence in your 20-70mm sweet spot.
- No distortion, vignetting, or edge sharpness concerns.
- Keep HX90 as backup for rare city telephoto moments.

**Phase 2: Buy Tamron 25-200mm Later (When Needed, ~$1,000-1,300)**
- Purchase only when you have a safari, wildlife, or sports trip planned.
- Tamron has faster aperture (f/2.8-5.6) than Sigma (f/3.5-6.3).
- Better low-light performance at telephoto end.
- Could be months or years away — defer the expense.

**Trip-by-Trip Lens Selection:**

| Trip Type                      | Lens to Pack     | Why                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **City travel (95% of trips)** | SEL2070G 20–70mm | Best quality, covers your 65-80% zone    |
| **Safari/wildlife**            | Tamron 25–200mm  | Need telephoto reach                     |
| **Sports events**              | Tamron 25–200mm  | Need telephoto for action                |
| **Mixed/uncertain**            | SEL2070G + HX90  | G-series quality + HX90 telephoto backup |

(why-this-makes-sense-for-you)=
#### Why This Makes Sense for You

**1. Your Data Supports This:**
- 65-80% of shots at 20-35mm (city street/architecture).
- Telephoto usage concentrates on specific trip types (Svalbard wildlife: 22% at 75mm).
- Most travel is city-based where 70mm is sufficient.

**2. HX90 as City Telephoto Backup:**
- For rare moments like "interesting thing happening far away".
- You're "recording" not "photographing artistically" — HX90 suffices.
- No need to carry superzoom on every city trip "just in case".

**3. Financial Flexibility:**
- Spend ~$1,100 now instead of ~$2,000-2,300.
- Defer ~$1,200 superzoom purchase until actually needed.
- If safari trip never materializes, you've saved money.
- If it does, buy the right tool at the right time.

**4. Avoids Superzoom Compromises:**
- No Sigma's severe 20mm distortion (-8.55%) on your primary lens.
- No vignetting concerns at wide end.
- No "weak 200mm" compromising telephoto shots when you DO need them.
- Tamron's f/2.8-5.6 better than Sigma's f/3.5-6.3.

(when-to-buy-the-superzoom)=
#### When to Buy the Superzoom

**Buy Tamron 25-200mm when:**
- ✅ Safari or wildlife trip is booked.
- ✅ Child's sports events become frequent.
- ✅ You find yourself wanting more telephoto reach consistently.
- ✅ HX90 telephoto quality is frustrating you.

**Don't rush to buy if:**
- ❌ No specific telephoto-heavy trip planned.
- ❌ HX90 is covering your occasional telephoto needs adequately.
- ❌ Your trips remain primarily city-focused.

(why-tamron-over-sigma-for-phase-2)=
#### Why Tamron Over Sigma for Phase 2

If you eventually buy a superzoom, **Tamron 25-200mm f/2.8-5.6** is preferable:
- **Faster aperture throughout:** f/2.8 at 25mm vs Sigma's f/3.5 at 20mm.
- **Better telephoto aperture:** f/5.6 at 200mm vs Sigma's f/6.3.
- **VXD linear motor AF:** Fast, accurate for moving subjects
  (wildlife, sports).
- **5mm narrower at wide end (25mm vs 20mm):** Acceptable since SEL2070G handles wide-angle.

The 25mm wide end isn't a problem because:
- You're NOT using this for city travel (SEL2070G handles that).
- Safari/wildlife rarely needs ultra-wide.
- You're optimizing for telephoto performance, not wide-angle.

**Bottom Line:** This staged approach gives you
**best-in-class quality for 95% of your trips now**,
with the **option to add telephoto capability later**
without being locked into a compromised superzoom.
Your instinct is correct—this is a smart, financially flexible strategy.

### Why Consider Superzooms Over SEL2070G + HX90

**1. Higher Quality in 70-200mm Range Than HX90**

- **HX90 reality:** 1/2.3-inch sensor class, small aperture at telephoto end.
- **These lenses:** Full-frame quality at 70-200mm on A7C II/A7 IV.
- **Image quality jump:** Dramatic improvement for telephoto shots.
- **Low-light advantage:** f/5.6-6.3 at 200mm >> HX90's effective aperture at equivalent focal length.

**2. Skip Investing in 70-200mm Later**

- **Traditional approach:** SEL2070G (20-70mm) + eventually 70-200mm f/4 (~$1,500 + ~$1,400 = ~$2,900).
- **Superzoom approach:** One lens covers 20-200mm or 25-200mm (~$900-1,300).
- **Cost savings:** Potentially ~$1,600 saved
  if you never buy 70-200mm.
- **Simplicity:** One lens instead of two for travel.

**3. Retire the HX90**

- **Current HX90 role:** 24-720mm backup for telephoto (2-5% of shots).
- **Superzoom coverage:** 70-200mm range with full-frame quality.
- **What you lose:** 200-720mm extreme telephoto (very rare use per your data).
- **What you gain:** One less device, better quality telephoto, simpler kit.

| Lofoten 2015     | ~23% at 75mm         | Minimal         | Landscape compression           |
| Svalbard 2015    | ~22% at 75mm         | 7% at 100-200mm | Wildlife/Arctic exceptions      |
| Samsung S25 2025 | ~15% at 69mm         | ~1% at 230mm+   | Digital zoom rarely used        |

**Key insight:** Your telephoto usage concentrates heavily at 70-85mm
for portraits and subject isolation.
The 100-200mm range is used sparingly (5-10% of trips),
and 200mm+ is extremely rare (<2%).

### Detailed: Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN Contemporary

**Pros:**

- ✅ **20mm wide end** - Matches your proven preference (same as SEL2070G).
- ✅ **200mm telephoto** - Eliminates 70-200mm lens need, replaces HX90 role.
- ✅ **10x zoom range** - One lens covers nearly everything.
- ✅ **Full-frame quality** - Massive upgrade over HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor at telephoto.
- ✅ **Compact for range** - Contemporary line prioritizes portability.
- ✅ **Better low-light** - f/3.5 at wide end vs HX90's smaller sensor.
- ✅ **Very good center sharpness** - Excellent resolution from 20-100mm (per LensTip testing).
- ✅ **Silent, accurate autofocus** - Quick AF with low focus breathing.
- ✅ **1:2 macro mode** - Added versatility for close-up work.

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **Slower aperture at telephoto** - f/6.3 at 200mm (vs f/4 on premium zooms).
- ⚠️ **No 200-720mm** - Loses HX90's extreme telephoto (rarely needed per data).
- ⚠️ **f/3.5-6.3 variable aperture** - Less consistent than f/4 constant aperture.

**⚠️ Critical Optical Concerns (from LensTip technical review, Jan 2026):**

- ❌ **Severe distortion at 20mm** - Up to -8.55% barrel distortion
  with pronounced "moustache" pattern on full frame.
  LensTip: *"I haven't seen such vicious moustache for a very long time."*
  While software correction brings this down to -0.61%,
  this correction **costs pixels and effective resolution**.
- ❌ **Significant pincushion distortion at telephoto** - +3.21% to +3.48% at 100-200mm range
- ❌ **Heavy vignetting on full frame** - Listed as major con; requires correction
- ❌ **200mm is the weak point** - Sharpness drops notably at maximum focal length, especially at frame edges. Decent images only around f/8.
- ❌ **Resolution penalty from distortion correction** -
  The massive geometric corrections
  "waste a significant number of pixels and limit effective image resolution"

**📊 What This Means for Your Use Case:**

| Concern                  | Impact on Your Photography                                         | Mitigation                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **20mm distortion**      | Architecture with straight lines will show bowing unless corrected | Auto-correction works but reduces effective resolution                            |
| **Moustache distortion** | Horizon lines may appear wavy at edges at 20mm                     | Most visible in landscapes with clear horizons                                    |
| **200mm softness**       | Telephoto portraits/details less sharp than premium 70-200mm       | Stop down to f/8 for best results; the 85mm prime handles portraits better anyway |
| **Vignetting**           | Dark corners on full frame, especially at 20mm                     | Software correctable but adds post-processing                                     |

**Balanced Assessment:**

The Sigma 20-200mm delivers **excellent center sharpness**
across most of its range (20-100mm)
and represents a remarkable engineering achievement for a 10x superzoom.
However, it relies heavily on software correction for distortion and vignetting—
a common trade-off in modern superzooms.
For **casual travel photography** where you're not pixel-peeping or printing large,
these compromises are acceptable.
For **architecture photography with critical straight lines**
or **edge-to-edge sharpness demands**,
the SEL2070G remains the better choice for your primary 20-70mm zone.

**Data-based coverage:** 95%+ of your shooting needs, replaces both SEL2070G range AND HX90 role

### Detailed: Tamron 25-200mm f/2.8-5.6 Di III VXD G2

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Faster aperture** - f/2.8 at 25mm, f/5.6 at 200mm (better than Sigma).
- ✅ **Excellent build quality** - G2 generation improvements.
- ✅ **VXD linear motor AF** - Fast, accurate autofocus for moving children.
- ✅ **Tamron quality** - Known for excellent superzoom optical performance.
- ✅ **Full-frame 200mm quality** - Dramatically better than HX90 at telephoto.

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **25mm wide end** - 5mm narrower than your preferred 20mm (same as old 24mm constraint).
- ⚠️ **Repeats 24-25mm limitation** - Doesn't break your historical wide-angle constraint.
- ⚠️ **Still variable aperture** - Though faster than Sigma.
- ⚠️ **No 200-720mm** - Loses extreme telephoto reach.

**Data-based coverage:** 90-95% coverage, but wide end doesn't improve on your 24mm history

### 🎯 Recommendation: Sigma vs Tamron for Your Use Case

**Choose Sigma 20-200mm if:**
- ✅ **You value the 20mm wide end** (matches SEL2070G, breaks your 24mm constraint).
- ✅ You accept f/6.3 at telephoto end (IBIS + high ISO compensate).
- ✅ You want maximum zoom range (10x vs 8x).
- ✅ Price matters (~$100-200 cheaper expected).
- **Best for your documented shooting style** - 20mm wide end aligns with your data.

**Choose Tamron 25–200mm if:**
- ⚠️ You prioritize faster aperture throughout the range.
- ⚠️ You can accept 25mm wide end (same as your historical 24mm constraint).
- ⚠️ You value Tamron's VXD AF motor speed.
- **Less ideal for you as primary lens** - Wide end doesn't improve your constraint.
- ✅ **Excellent for Option 1C** - Buy later when safari/wildlife trip is planned.

**Option 3 (16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime):** Not included in table above
as it's a specialized ultra-wide setup that accepts a 35-85mm gap.
Best for landscape-focused photographers who prioritize the widest possible field
of view (16mm) over versatility. See [Option 3](#option-3-16-35mm-f4-ultra-wide-specialist) for details.

### Final Verdict on Superzoom Strategy

**Consider Option 1B (Sigma 20-200mm) IF:**

1. ✅ **Higher 70-200mm quality matters NOW** - HX90's small sensor limits telephoto quality.
2. ✅ **You want to retire HX90** - Simplify to one main lens.
3. ✅ **You rarely use 200mm+** - Your data shows <2% usage above 200mm.
4. ✅ **You value kit simplicity** - One superzoom vs SEL2070G + HX90 combo.
5. ✅ **You want to avoid future 70-200mm purchase** - Complete coverage now.
6. ✅ **You shoot primarily for memories, not pixel-peeping** - Casual travel/family photography.
7. ✅ **You accept software distortion correction** - Modern cameras handle this automatically.

**Stick with SEL2070G IF:**

1. ✅ **Optical quality at 20-70mm is priority** - G-series beats superzoom at this range.
2. ✅ **You shoot architecture with critical straight lines** - Sigma's 20mm distortion may bother you.
3. ✅ **You want edge-to-edge sharpness without compromise** - Superzoom has inherent trade-offs.
4. ✅ **You want 200-720mm option** - Keep HX90 for rare extreme telephoto.
5. ✅ **f/4 constant aperture matters** - More predictable exposure.
6. ✅ **You may still buy 70-200mm later** - SEL2070G + 70-200 f/4 = premium two-lens kit.

**🔍 Updated Assessment After LensTip Review (Jan 2026):**

The LensTip technical review revealed the Sigma 20-200mm
has **more optical compromises than initially expected**, particularly:
- Severe barrel distortion (-8.55%) and moustache pattern at 20mm
- Heavy vignetting on full frame
- 200mm being the weakest focal length for sharpness

**However**, the review also confirmed:
- Excellent center sharpness from 20-100mm
- Good edge sharpness on APS-C crop
- Fast, accurate autofocus
- Very good image quality for a 10x superzoom

**Practical Recommendation:**

The Sigma 20-200mm remains compelling for your use case IF:
- You shoot primarily for travel memories and family documentation
- You accept that software correction handles distortion automatically
- You value the massive simplicity gain over pixel-perfect results
- Your 200mm usage is occasional (the 85mm prime handles portraits better anyway)

**However, the SEL2070G recommendation is strengthened because:**
- Your 65-80% wide-angle usage means the 20-70mm quality matters most
- The G-series optics provide noticeably better results where you shoot most
- The Sigma's distortion at 20mm may be visible in architecture/landscape shots
- If you later want premium telephoto, adding a 70-200mm f/4 gives you best-in-class at both ranges

**Consider Option 1C (Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy) IF:**
- Most of your trips are city travel where 70mm is sufficient.
- Safari/wildlife trips are planned events (you know months ahead).
- You want G-series quality NOW without optical compromises.
- You prefer buying the right tool when actually needed.
- HX90 is adequate for rare city telephoto shots (2-5% of shots).
- You may not need a superzoom for years—defer the investment.

**Bottom Line:**
- **Maximum quality at 20-70mm:** SEL2070G + HX90 (Option 1A)
- **Maximum convenience everywhere:** Sigma 20-200mm (Option 1B)—but with optical caveats per LensTip review
- **Best of both worlds with staged investment:** SEL2070G now + Tamron later (Option 1C)

**Note:** Both Sigma 20-200mm and Tamron 25-200mm are newer
lenses - verify availability and read early reviews before purchasing.

## 🎒 Practicality Reality Check: Two Zooms (20-70mm + 70-200mm) on Non-Photography Trips

**A critical consideration often overlooked in gear discussions:**

Your trips are **not photography-dedicated**—
you're traveling with a 4-year-old,
balancing family experiences with documentation.
This fundamentally changes the calculus for a two-zoom kit.

(the-two-zoom-dream-vs-reality)=
### The Two-Zoom Dream vs. Reality

**The Traditional Enthusiast Kit:**
- 20–70mm f/4 G for wide-to-normal coverage
- 70-200mm f/4 G for telephoto reach
- Combined: ~970g lens weight, ~$2,500 investment

**Sounds perfect on paper. But consider your actual travel rhythm:**

### Why Two Zooms May Not Suit Your Travel Style

**1. Lens Changes Are Photography Interruptions**

When your child spots something exciting,
you have seconds to capture the moment—not time to:
- Stop walking
- Open your bag
- Swap lenses carefully
- Store the removed lens
- Resume the moment (which may have passed)

Your data shows **65-80% of shots at 20-35mm**—
meaning the 70-200mm would sit in your bag most of the time,
occasionally needed but requiring a disruptive workflow.

**2. Weight Penalty Is Constant, Usage Is Sporadic**

| Consideration                | SEL2070G Only | Two-Zoom Kit    | Superzoom       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Lens weight on body**      | 488g          | 488g OR 1,090g* | ~570g           |
| **Bag weight (backup lens)** | None          | 488g OR 1,090g* | None            |
| **Total lens weight**        | 488g          | 1,578g          | ~570g           |
| **70-200mm usage**           | 0% (use HX90) | 10-20%*         | 100% (built-in) |
| **Lens changes/day**         | 0             | 3-8 typical*    | 0               |

*Estimated based on your telephoto usage patterns

You carry the **weight penalty constantly**
but only benefit from the second lens **occasionally**.

**3. The "Just in Case" Trap**

Two-zoom photographers often report:
- Bringing both lenses "just in case"
- Leaving the 70-200mm mounted on camera (heavier all day)
- OR leaving it in bag and missing shots because switching takes too long
- Returning home with 90% of shots on the wide zoom anyway

Your data validates this concern:
even on photography-focused trips (Japan 2018, SAGA 2014-2015),
wide-angle dominated at 45-60% of shots.

**4. Family Travel Context Matters**

When you're:
- Holding your child's hand crossing streets
- Carrying their snack bag, water bottle, spare clothes
- Responding to "Look at that!" moments
- Navigating crowded tourist sites
- Dealing with nap time, bathroom breaks, meal logistics

**The last thing you need is lens-swap workflow complexity.**

### When Two Zooms WOULD Make Sense

**1. Photography-Dedicated Trips (Solo or Adult-Only)**
- Intentional landscape or wildlife photography
- Planned portrait sessions
- Time and mental space for gear optimization
- *Not your typical travel pattern*

**2. Safari or Wildlife Scenarios**
- Predictable subjects at distance
- Vehicle-based shooting (gear accessible)
- Long periods of stationary observation
- *Rare in your documented travel history*

**3. Sports/Event Photography**
- Dedicated shooting position
- Extended coverage at single focal length
- *Not your primary use case*

### Why Superzooms Exist: Solving the Two-Zoom Problem

The Sigma 20-200mm and Tamron 25-200mm represent a deliberate compromise:

| Factor                      | Two-Zoom Kit       | Superzoom Solution |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Coverage**                | 20-200mm (same)    | 20-200mm (same)    |
| **Lens changes**            | Multiple per day   | Zero               |
| **Weight**                  | ~1,500g            | ~570g              |
| **Missed moments**          | Swapping-induced   | Minimal            |
| **Optical quality**         | Excellent per lens | Good overall       |
| **Travel-with-child score** | ⚠️ Complex          | ✅ Practical        |

**The superzoom trade-off**: Slightly lower optical quality across the range
in exchange for dramatically simpler workflow and lighter kit.

(your-data-supports-single-lens-simplicity)=
#### Your Data Supports Single-Lens Simplicity

**Evidence from your shooting patterns:**

1. **Mobile phone usage: 28% of all shots** → You value convenience
2. **HX90 as "backup" rather than primary** → You don't enjoy device-juggling
3. **65-80% at 20-35mm** → You'd rarely use the second lens
4. **"Selected" photos favor wide-angle MORE** → Your best work doesn't need 70-200mm
5. **Multi-camera trips still show wide-angle dominance** → Even with options, you gravitate to wide

### Practical Recommendation for Non-Photography Trips

**For your typical family travel:**

| Option                               | Recommendation             | Why                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1A: SEL2070G + HX90**       | ✅ Good choice              | G-series quality + HX90 telephoto backup        |
| **Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm**        | ✅ **Strongly recommended** | One lens, zero swaps, full coverage             |
| **Option 1C: SEL2070G (city trips)** | ✅ **Excellent for cities** | Right tool for each trip; most trips are cities |
| **SEL2070G + 70-200mm**              | ⚠️ **Consider carefully**   | Substantial complexity for occasional benefit   |
| **Three-lens kit**                   | ❌ Avoid                    | Diminishing returns, maximum hassle             |

**Key principle:** Match your gear complexity to your trip type.
- Photography trip → Consider two zooms
- Safari/wildlife trip → Bring Tamron 25-200mm (Option 1C Phase 2)
- Family/casual city travel → SEL2070G alone is sufficient (Options 1A or 1C)

### The Decision Matrix

**Choose SEL2070G + 70-200mm IF:**
- ❓ You're willing to change lenses multiple times daily
- ❓ You value maximum telephoto quality over convenience
- ❓ You have dedicated photography time during trips
- ❓ Weight isn't a primary concern
- ❓ You're comfortable with complex workflows

**Choose Superzoom (Option 1B: Sigma 20-200mm) IF:**
- ✅ Your trips are not photography-dedicated
- ✅ You're traveling with a young child
- ✅ You value moment-capture over maximum quality
- ✅ Lens changes feel like interruptions
- ✅ You want the simplest possible workflow NOW
- ⚠️ You accept the optical trade-offs (20mm distortion, 200mm weakness)

**Choose Two-Lens Flexibility (Option 1C) IF:**
- ✅ Most trips are city travel where 70mm is sufficient
- ✅ Safari/wildlife trips are planned events (you know ahead)
- ✅ You want G-series quality without compromise on city trips
- ✅ You prefer staged investment (buy superzoom only when needed)
- ✅ HX90 adequately handles rare city telephoto needs

**This analysis supports multiple strategies depending on your priorities.
For maximum simplicity NOW, Option 1B (Sigma). For maximum quality in your primary zone, Options 1A or 1C.**

(important-considerations-a7c-ii-vs-a7-iv)=
#### ⚠️ **Important Considerations: A7C II vs A7 IV**

**Your Concerns Are Valid - Here's the Reality:**

**1. Ergonomics & Handling (A7C II "Too Small" Concern):**

**A7C II Grip Reality:**
- **Shallow grip depth** - Some find it cramped, especially with larger lenses.
- **Rangefinder-style body** - Different from traditional DSLR ergonomics.
- **Smaller front grip** - Less to hold onto compared to A7 IV.
- **Better with smaller lenses** - Works great with SEL2070G (488g), less ideal with heavy telephotos.

**Who struggles with A7C II grip:**
- Photographers with larger hands (though you mentioned yours aren't big).
- Those upgrading from DSLR-style cameras (muscle memory expects deeper grip).
- Users who frequently shoot with heavy lenses (24-70mm f/2.8 GM at 886g).
- Anyone who values tactile controls over compact size.

**Who loves A7C II grip:**
- Mirrorless-first shooters (no DSLR habits to break).
- Street/travel photographers prioritizing low profile.
- Users pairing with compact lenses (like SEL2070G f/4).
- Those coming from compact cameras or smartphones.

**Practical solution if concerned:** Try both in a camera store before buying.
The A7C II feels VERY different from A7 IV - this is highly personal.

**2. Build Quality & Robustness (A7 IV More Robust Concern):**

**Build Quality Comparison:**

| Aspect                   | A7C II         | A7 IV               | Verdict                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Weather sealing**      | ✅ Full sealing | ✅ Full sealing      | **Equal** - both weather-sealed |
| **Magnesium alloy body** | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes               | **Equal** - same materials      |
| **Shutter durability**   | 200,000 cycles | 200,000 cycles      | **Equal**                       |
| **Port covers**          | Plastic        | Metal               | **A7 IV better**                |
| **Button feel**          | Compact/tight  | Larger/more tactile | **A7 IV better**                |
| **Overall robustness**   | Very good      | Excellent           | **A7 IV slightly better**       |

**Reality Check:**

- **Both are professional-grade cameras** - Neither is "fragile"
- **Weather sealing identical** - Both handle rain, dust, light snow
- **A7C II is NOT a "toy camera"** - Same internal construction as A7 IV
- **Main difference: Size, not strength** - Compact doesn't mean weak

**Where A7 IV feels more robust:**
- **Metal port covers** vs plastic on A7C II (HDMI, USB-C, mic).
- **Larger buttons** - easier to press with gloves, less accidental presses.
- **Deeper grip** - feels more "planted" in hand during active shooting.
- **Psychological factor** - bigger = feels more substantial (even if specs are similar).

**Where concerns are overstated:**
- A7C II has same magnesium alloy chassis.
- Same shutter mechanism and durability rating.
- Same lens mount strength.
- Both cameras can handle professional use.

**For Your Use Case (Casual Travel Photography with Family):**

**A7C II is sufficiently robust if:**
- ✅ You're not shooting in extreme conditions (Antarctic expedition, monsoon).
- ✅ Primary use is travel/family photography (not professional sports/wildlife).
- ✅ You care about carrying lighter gear while chasing a 4-year-old.
- ✅ You pair with lighter lenses (SEL2070G is perfect match).

**Choose A7 IV if:**
- ⚠️ You value the "feel" of a substantial camera body.
- ⚠️ You want the most comfortable all-day handling.
- ⚠️ The 144g weight penalty doesn't concern you.
- ⚠️ You prefer traditional DSLR-style ergonomics.

**Honest Assessment for Your Situation:**

**Ergonomics:** The A7C II grip IS smaller - this is real, not imagined.
If you've never held a compact rangefinder-style camera,
it WILL feel different. However, with the lightweight SEL2070G (488g),
the system is well-balanced. With heavier lenses, the grip becomes more noticeable.

**Robustness:** The difference is MINIMAL for real-world durability.
Both cameras will survive normal travel photography abuse.
The A7 IV's slight edge (metal port covers, larger buttons) matters more
for professional daily use than casual travel shooting.

**Recommendation:** If possible, **handle both cameras in a store** before deciding.
The grip size difference is subjective -
what feels cramped to one person feels perfect to another.
Your data shows you value portability (28% mobile usage),
but ergonomics trump weight if you can't comfortably hold the camera.

**Safe middle ground:** A7 IV offers peace of mind on both concerns
(better grip, slightly more robust feel)
for only ~$100-200 more and 144g extra weight.
Given you're investing ~$3,300–3,600 total,
the A7 IV premium might be worth it if the grip concern is genuine.

---

### ❌ NOT Recommended: **Sony A7R Series** (A7R V, A7R IV)

**High-Resolution Bodies NOT Suited for Your Needs:**

**Why A7R is Wrong for You:**

1. **Overkill resolution (61MP)**
   - Your mobile photos (28% of output) are 12MP - you're fine with that.
   - You don't print large (no mention in 21-year data).
   - Higher MP = larger files, slower workflow, more storage.

2. **File size burden**
   - 61MP RAW = ~120MB/file vs 33MP = ~65MB/file.
   - Japan 2018: 4,508 photos × 120MB = 541GB vs 293GB.
   - Storage/backup costs add up fast.

3. **Diminishing returns**
   - 65-80% wide-angle shooting doesn't benefit from high MP.
   - Telephoto crops could use it, but you shoot <10% telephoto.
   - SEL2070G f/4 isn't optimized for ultra-high resolution.

4. **Weight penalty**
   - A7R V: 723g vs A7C II: 514g (209g = 41% heavier).
   - Traveling with child = weight matters.

5. **Slower shooting**
   - Larger files = slower burst, slower buffer clearing.
   - Moving children need responsive camera, not maximum resolution.

6. **Price premium without benefit**
   - A7R V: ~$3,900 vs A7C II: ~$2,200.
   - Extra $1,700 buys ZERO practical benefit for your shooting.

**Data-based verdict:** 21 years of shooting shows you value convenience
and storytelling over technical specs. A7R is professional tool you don't need.

## 🎯 Decision Guide: Choose Your Strategy

> 💡 **Practical Note:** Options 1A and 1C have the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~$1,100).
> You don't need to decide between them now—buy the SEL2070G, use it, and decide later
> whether to keep HX90 indefinitely (1A) or add Tamron when a safari trip is planned (1C).

### Choose **SEL2070G 20-70mm f/4 G** (Options 1A or 1C) if:

- ✅ **Optical quality at 20-70mm is paramount** - G-series excellence in your 85-90% zone.
- ✅ You've been constrained by 24mm and want wider (20mm).
- ✅ You're okay keeping HX90 as telephoto backup (2-5% usage).
- ✅ **f/4 constant aperture matters** - predictable exposure.
- ✅ Budget: ~$1,650-1,700 for lenses (SEL2070G + 85mm) is acceptable.
- ✅ **Best for:** Maximum quality in your primary shooting zone.

### Choose **Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DG DN** (Option 1B) if:

- ✅ **You want to retire HX90 immediately** - simplify to 2 devices now
- ✅ **Better telephoto quality matters** - full-frame 70-200mm >> HX90's small 1/2.3-inch sensor
- ✅ **You want to skip future 70-200mm investment** - complete coverage now
- ✅ **Kit simplification is priority** - one lens covers 95%+
- ✅ **You shoot primarily for memories** - not pixel-peeping or large prints
- ✅ **You accept software distortion correction** - cameras handle this automatically.
- ⚠️ You accept the trade-offs: severe 20mm distortion, weaker 200mm edges, heavy vignetting.
- ✅ Budget: ~$1,450-1,700 for lenses (Sigma + 85mm).
- ✅ **Best for:** Simpler kit with dramatically better telephoto—but **read the LensTip review**
  to understand optical compromises.

### Choose **Two-Lens Flexibility Strategy** (Option 1C) if:

- ✅ **Most trips are city travel** - don't need telephoto beyond 70mm.
- ✅ **You want G-series quality now** - no compromises at 20-70mm.
- ✅ **Safari/wildlife trips are predictable** - you know months ahead.
- ✅ **You prefer staged investment** - ~$1,100 now, ~$1,000-1,300 later (only if needed).
- ✅ **HX90 is adequate for rare city telephoto** - acceptable quality for 2-5% of shots.
- ✅ **You may not need superzoom for years** - defer the cost indefinitely.
- ✅ **When you DO need telephoto, you want quality** - Tamron f/2.8-5.6 beats Sigma f/3.5-6.3.
- ✅ Budget: ~$1,650-1,700 now for lenses (SEL2070G + 85mm); superzoom ~$1,000-1,300 can wait.
- ✅ **Best for:** Photographers who mostly travel cities and prefer buying the right tool when actually needed.

### Choose **24-70mm f/2.8 GM** if:

- ⚠️ You absolutely need f/2.8 for low-light work.
- ⚠️ Don't mind the extra weight (886g vs 488g).
- ⚠️ Budget allows $2,200.
- ⚠️ Willing to repeat 24mm limitation.
- ⚠️ **Not recommended for you.**

### Choose **16-35mm f/4** if:

- ⚠️ You prioritize ultra-wide over versatility.
- ⚠️ Don't mind carrying multiple lenses.
- ⚠️ Willing to accept 35-85mm gap.
- ⚠️ **Less ideal for your travel style.**

## ⚠️ Critical Insights About Your Photography

1. **24mm was your constraint, not your preference**

   - You shot 40-70% at 24mm because it was your ONLY wide option.
   - Given 20mm, you'll likely use it MORE than 24mm.
   - Mobile data shows you use 13mm ultra-wide 5-8% consistently
     (Samsung S22/S25).
   - When given 17-18mm ultra-wide on Huawei phones,
     you used it 13-14% of time.
   - **Conclusion:** You actively seek wider than 23-24mm when available.

2. **Budapest 75mm usage is misleading**

   - This was a portrait session, not typical travel.
   - 75mm was the far end of your SAL1650 lens at the time.
   - Not representative of your normal shooting patterns.
   - The recommended 85mm prime covers this specialized need.

3. **Your kit has evolved perfectly FOR the 20-70mm range**

   - Mobile handles ultra-wide (13mm) - 8% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - Mobile handles standard wide (23mm) - 64% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - Mobile handles 3x telephoto (69mm) - 15% of Samsung S25 photos.
   - 85mm prime handles dedicated portraits.
   - HX90 handles extreme telephoto (24-720mm backup).
   - **SEL2070G fills the quality gap:**
     20-70mm for serious photography.

4. **Single lens workflow matches your style**

   - 90-95% of shots in 20-70mm range.
   - You prefer convenience
     (evidenced by 15,528 mobile photos = 28% of total output).
   - Mobile usage accelerating: 3,296 photos in <1 year on Samsung S25.
   - Lens changing minimized = better travel experience.

5. **Mobile phone is your SECOND camera, not backup**

   - 15,528 mobile photos with intentional focal length choices.
   - 75% shot at primary wide (23-29mm) - deliberate storytelling choice.
   - Multi-camera phones: You actively switch between ultra-wide, wide, telephoto.
   - Samsung S25: Most balanced usage (64% primary, 15% tele, 8% ultra-wide, 5% mid-range).
   - This isn't "phone snapshot" behavior - it's intentional photography.

### **Alternative Strategies**

**🥉 Budget: Mobile + 85mm + HX90** (~$550-600 for 85mm prime only) - If minimizing cost.
You're already shooting 30-50% on mobile.

---

## 📌 Quick Reference Summary

1. **Your shooting evolved**: Normal (35mm) → Wide (24mm) → Ultra-wide (13-23mm).
2. **24mm was historically your widest** - both SEL2070G and Sigma 20-200mm give you 20mm.
3. **Sony FE 85mm f/1.8 recommended** (~$550-600) - dedicated portrait lens for low-light and shallow DOF.
4. **Mobile phone is a capable ultra-wide** - 13mm handles dramatic wide shots.
5. **HX90 can be retired** with Sigma 20-200mm (or kept with SEL2070G / Two-Lens Strategy).
6. **50-70mm is your "dead zone"** - minimal documented usage (but nice to have).
7. **Trip types are predictable** - city travel vs. safari/wildlife trips are planned differently.

**Three Top Strategies (Plus One Alternative):**

- **Best optical quality at 20-70mm:** SEL2070G (Options 1A/1C - G-series excellence in your 85-90% zone).
- **Best kit simplification:** Sigma 20-200mm (Option 1B - retire HX90 + full-frame telephoto—but with optical trade-offs).
- **Best flexibility with staged investment:** Two-Lens Strategy (Option 1C - SEL2070G now + Tamron later when needed).
- **Alternative - ultra-wide specialization:** 16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime (Option 3 - accept 35-85mm gap).
- **All break your 24mm constraint** with 16-20mm wide end.

## 🎯 Bottom Line: Your Optimal Lens Strategy

Based on 56,196 photos analyzed across 21 years
(40,668+ dedicated camera + 15,528 mobile),
you've proven you're a **wide-angle storyteller**
who values **environmental context** over **isolated subjects**.

**Mobile phone data confirms this:**

- 75% of your 15,528 mobile photos shot at 23-29mm wide angle
- When given ultra-wide (13-18mm), you use it 5-13% - proving you want WIDER
- Samsung S25: 64% at 23mm shows consistency with your 24mm dedication on dedicated cameras

With a young child, this style is PERFECT - it captures the experience, not just the subject.

### Your Three Top Strategies (Plus Alternative)

> 💡 **Practical tip:** Options 1A and 1C are the **same initial purchase** (SEL2070G ~$1,100).
> Buy the SEL2070G now, then decide later whether to keep HX90 for telephoto (1A) or add Tamron for safari trips (1C).

| Option | Strategy                    | Why It Works for You                                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1A** | SEL2070G (20-70mm f/4 G)    | Best optics in your 85-90% zone, light enough for travel with a 4-year-old      |
| **1B** | Sigma 20-200mm f/3.5-6.3    | Kit simplification, retire HX90, full-frame telephoto (with optical trade-offs) |
| **1C** | SEL2070G now + Tamron later | Staged investment—best quality now, add telephoto when safari trips happen      |
| **3**  | 16-35mm f/4 + 85mm prime    | *Alternative:* Ultra-wide specialization, accept 35-85mm gap                    |

**Most important tip:** The photos you'll treasure most aren't the technically perfect ones -
they're the ones that captured genuine moments.
Your wide-angle preference naturally creates these story-rich images.
Trust your instincts, keep it simple, and enjoy the adventure with your child.

**For growth:** Challenge yourself occasionally,
but never at the expense of capturing the moment.
The best photo technique is the one that gets you the shot
while your child is still willing to cooperate.

**Mobile insight:** Your 15,528 mobile photos aren't just "backup snapshots" -
they show intentional focal length choices matching your dedicated camera style
(ultra-wide for drama, 23mm for storytelling, 69mm for portraits).
You're already a multi-focal-length photographer;
any of the four strategies above brings that same versatility
to your dedicated camera with superior image quality.
