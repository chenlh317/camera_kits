## TODO

1. Revise the report and generate stats for focal stats even if no 35mm equivalent is provided.
Need to

   - Pivot by device model to get counts of images per device
   - Generate focal length stats per device model
   - If 35mm equivalent is not provided, compute it from `camera_crop_factors.yaml` using the camera model and crop factor.

2. More folders to scan for images
