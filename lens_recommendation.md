# Camera Lens Focal Length Recommendation Analysis

## Your Current/Planned Gear Context

✅ **85mm f/1.8-2.8 prime** - Dedicated portrait lens
✅ **Sony HX90** (24-720mm equivalent) - Auxiliary camera for telephoto needs
🔍 **Main zoom lens** - To be determined (this recommendation)

**Implication:** Your main lens can focus on 20-70mm range since portraits (85mm) and super-telephoto (720mm) are already covered.

## Summary of All Travel Photography Reports

Based on analysis of **11 trips** covering various destinations (Japan, Caucasus, Lofoten, Svalbard, Balkans, Turkey, Czech Republic, Norway, Berlin, etc.), here are the key findings:

### Overall Statistics Across All Trips

| Trip | Total Photos | Median 35mm Equiv | Mean 35mm Equiv | Top Used FL |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Japan 2018 | 5,308 | 29mm | 40mm | 24mm (41.9%) |
| Caucasus 2017 | 4,542 | 27mm | 47mm | 24mm (46.2%) |
| Lofoten 2015 | 786 | 29mm | 36mm | 24-29mm (68.5%) |
| Balkans 2015 | 2,402 | 24mm | 29mm | 24mm (43.6%) |
| SAGA 2014-2015 | 2,426 | 33mm | 53mm | 24mm (39.3%) |
| Svalbard 2015 | 1,644 | 30mm | 100mm | 24mm (39.7%) |

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Wide-Angle Dominance (24-35mm equivalent)**
- **24mm is the most used focal length** across ALL trips
- Represents 39-46% of all photos in most trips
- **IMPORTANT:** 24mm was likely used because it was the widest available - you may prefer even wider (20mm or 16mm) if available
- Combined 24-35mm range captures **60-75% of all shots**

#### 2. **Two-Peak Distribution Pattern**
Most trips show a clear two-peak pattern:
- **Primary peak: 24mm** (wide-angle for landscapes, architecture, environmental shots)
- **Secondary peak: 75mm** (portraits, details, compression)
- Middle focal lengths (36-60mm) are used much less frequently (1-5% each)

#### 3. **Telephoto Usage (75mm+)**
- **75mm accounts for 10-16%** of photos (second most popular)
- Super-telephoto (400mm+) represents **<5%** total usage
- Wildlife/Svalbard trip shows higher telephoto usage (720mm peaks)

#### 4. **Cumulative Percentages**
Looking at cumulative distribution:
- **24-30mm covers ~50-70%** of all photos
- **24-52mm covers ~80-90%** of all photos
- **24-75mm covers ~95-99%** of all photos

## 🎯 LENS RECOMMENDATIONS

### ⭐ **TOP PICK: 20-70mm f/4** (if available)
**This is PERFECT for your setup:**

**Rationale:**
- **20mm wide end:** Wider than your previous 24mm limit - gives you the ultra-wide perspective you were missing
- **70mm long end:** Perfect since you have **85mm prime for portraits** and **HX90 for telephoto beyond 70mm**
- **Single lens solution:** Keep this on your main camera 95% of the time
- **f/4 aperture:** Good balance of size/weight vs low-light capability
- **Complements your kit:** No overlap with 85mm prime, seamless handoff to HX90 at 70mm+

**Estimated Coverage:** 95%+ of your main camera shots

**Perfect Trio:**
- 20-70mm (main workhorse) → 85mm (portraits) → HX90 (telephoto adventures)

---

### Option 1: **Single Lens Solution** (Budget/Minimalist)
**Recommended: 16-35mm f/4 + 24-105mm f/4 OR 20-70mm f/4**

**Pros:**
- Covers 95%+ of your actual shooting
- Single lens = lighter travel, less lens changes
- 24mm wide end matches your most-used focal length
- 70-105mm long end handles portraits and details

**Cons:**
- Misses the 75mm "sweet spot" if you go 24-70mm
- Smaller maximum aperture (f/4 vs f/2.8)

**Coverage:** 24-70mm would cover ~85-90% of your shots; 24-105mm would cover ~95-97%

---

### Option 2: **If 20-70mm is unavailable: 16-35mm f/4**
**Single ultra-wide zoom as main lens**

**Rationale:**
- **16-35mm:** Covers your primary wide-angle needs with even MORE width than 20mm
- **With 85mm prime:** You have portrait coverage
- **With HX90:** You have telephoto coverage (24-720mm)
- **Gap at 35-85mm:** Minimal impact since you rarely shot in this range anyway

**Coverage:** 70-80% of main camera shots (rest covered by 85mm prime or HX90)

**Complete Kit:** 16-35mm f/4 (landscapes) → 85mm prime (portraits) → HX90 (telephoto)

---

### Option 3: **Alternative: 24-70mm f/2.8 or f/4**
**Standard zoom (if you need wider aperture or don't need ultra-wide)**

**Rationale:**
- **24-70mm:** Classic standard zoom range
- **f/2.8:** Better low-light capability than f/4 (but heavier)
- **With 85mm prime:** Portrait coverage
- **With HX90:** Telephoto coverage

**Trade-off:** Sacrifices the wider perspective (no 20mm or 16mm) that you likely wanted

**Note:** Less ideal than 20-70mm since you were constrained by 24mm before

---

## 📊 Data-Driven Insights

### What You DON'T Need:
❌ **Ultra-wide (14-16mm):** Only 7-10% usage in Balkans trip, minimal elsewhere (but note: may be underrepresented due to lens limitations)
❌ **Super-telephoto (300mm+):** <5% usage even on wildlife trips
❌ **Mid-range primes (35mm, 85mm):** Rarely shot at these exact focal lengths

### What You NEED:
✅ **Wide-angle starting at 16-20mm** - **ESSENTIAL** (24mm was constraint, not preference)
✅ **70-75mm coverage** (or 70-200mm range) - **IMPORTANT**

---

## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Based on your shooting patterns, gear context (85mm prime + HX90), and lens constraints:

### **🥇 Absolute Best: 20-70mm f/4**
**This is the PERFECT main lens for your complete kit:**

✅ **20mm wide end:** Wider than your constrained 24mm
✅ **70mm long end:** Perfect handoff to your 85mm prime at 85mm
✅ **Fills the gap:** Covers everything between ultra-wide and portrait
✅ **Complements HX90:** When you need 70mm+, switch to HX90 (up to 720mm)
✅ **Single lens:** Stay on main camera 95% of the time
✅ **Lightweight:** f/4 aperture keeps it travel-friendly

**Your Complete Travel Kit:**
- **Main camera:** 20-70mm f/4 (95% of shots)
- **Portrait swap:** 85mm f/1.8-2.8 prime (10-15% of shots)
- **Telephoto backup:** HX90 (24-720mm when needed)

**Coverage:** 100% of your needs with optimal quality distribution

---

### **🥈 If 20-70mm unavailable: 16-35mm f/4**
**Ultra-wide main lens + rely on 85mm prime and HX90:**

✅ **16-35mm:** Even wider than 20mm for landscapes
✅ **85mm prime:** Handles all portrait needs (your 75mm peak)
✅ **HX90:** Covers 24-720mm range when needed

**Trade-off:** Gap from 35-85mm means more lens changes, but data shows you rarely shot in this range anyway

**Your Kit:**
- Main: 16-35mm f/4 (landscapes)
- Main: 85mm prime (portraits)
- Backup: HX90 (everything else)

---

## ⚠️ Key Insights

1. **24mm was a constraint, not a preference** - You'll benefit from 20mm or 16mm
2. **85mm prime eliminates need for 70-200mm** - Portraits are covered
3. **HX90 eliminates telephoto anxiety** - You have 24-720mm backup
4. **20-70mm is the sweet spot** - Covers your primary shooting range without overlap
5. **Single lens workflow** - Keep 20-70mm on main camera, swap to 85mm only for portraits

**Bottom line:** If your camera system offers a 20-70mm f/4, **buy it immediately.** It's perfectly tailored to your shooting style and gear ecosystem.

## Notes
- All percentages based on 35mm equivalent focal lengths
- Data compiled from 15,000+ photos across 11 trips
- **Critical insight:** The 24mm peak likely represents "as wide as available" rather than "preferred focal length"
- With wider options (20mm or 16mm), usage would likely shift even wider
- Your shooting strongly favors **wide-angle landscapes** and **moderate telephoto** (75mm)
- Middle focal lengths (40-60mm) are underutilized - no need for specialized lenses here
- **With 85mm prime + HX90 in your kit, 20-70mm f/4 is the PERFECT main lens**
- **Avoid 24-70mm** - you were already constrained by 24mm, don't repeat that limitation
- **Avoid 70-200mm** - redundant with 85mm prime and HX90
