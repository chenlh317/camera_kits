# Camera Lens Focal Length Recommendation Analysis

**Analysis Date:** January 16, 2026
**Data Source:** 72 photo collections spanning 2004-2025
**Total Photos Analyzed:** 40,000+ with 35mm equivalent focal length data

## Your Current/Planned Gear Context

✅ **85mm f/1.8-2.8 prime** - Dedicated portrait lens
✅ **Sony HX90** (24-720mm equivalent) - Auxiliary camera for telephoto needs
✅ **Mobile phones** - 13mm/23mm/27mm ultra-wide and wide angles
🔍 **Main zoom lens** - To be determined (this recommendation)

**Implication:** Your main lens should focus on the 23-70mm range since ultra-wide (mobile), portraits (85mm prime), and super-telephoto (720mm HX90) are already covered.

#### 3. **Portrait/Telephoto Sweet Spot: 75mm**
- **Secondary peak across many trips**
- **Usage:** 10-25% when available
- **Applications:** Portraits, architectural details, subject isolation
- **Note:** Already covered by your 85mm f/1.8 prime
