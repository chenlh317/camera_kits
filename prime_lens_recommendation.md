### 🥉 **Ultra-Budget: Viltrox AF 35mm f/1.8 FE**

| Specification   | Value        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| **Aperture**    | f/1.8 - f/22 |
| **Weight**      | ~320g        |
| **Filter**      | 52mm         |
| **Close Focus** | 0.35m        |
| **Price**       | ~$350-400    |

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ **Half the price** of Sony - significant savings
- ✅ **Fast f/1.8** - Same light gathering as Sony
- ✅ **Good optics** - 10 elements, 2 ED + 2 aspherical elements
- ✅ **Punchy rendering** - More micro-contrast than Sony's "dreamy" look
- ⚠️ **Long minimum focus (40cm)** - Much longer than Sony (22cm) or Sigma (27cm)
- ⚠️ **AF limitations** - Occasionally front-focuses; AF-C less reliable than AF-S
- ⚠️ **De-clicked aperture ring** - Stiff and difficult to grip
- ⚠️ **No weather sealing** mentioned by manufacturer

**Review-Based Note:** "Great optics for the price... 85-90% of Sony at 50% of the cost." Works well in AF-S mode; check for firmware updates as Viltrox actively improves AF tuning.

**Verdict:** Best value if budget is tight. The 40cm close focus is a real limitation for environmental portraits. Consider if you need to get close to subjects.

- ✅ Night city: 35mm f/1.8 (architecture, street scenes)
- ✅ Kid portraits: 85mm f/1.8 (isolation, bokeh)
- ✅ Mobile 13-23mm covers ultra-wide needs

**Pros:**
- Lightest premium kit
- Fastest AF for kids (native Sony)
- Best low-light (both f/1.8)
- Weather-sealed for travel

**Cons:**
- 35-85mm gap (mobile's 46-69mm helps)
- No ultra-wide on dedicated camera

---

### Strategy B: Budget-Optimized

**Lenses:**
| Lens                   | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sigma 35mm f/2 DG DN   | Night city, indoor events | $700     | 325g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits             | $350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~$1,050-1,100 | 623g both primes

**Coverage:** Same as Strategy A

**Pros:**
- Save ~$300-450 vs Sony pair
- Sigma's premium metal build
- Viltrox Evo's fast VCM autofocus
- **Lightest kit** (623g vs 651g Sony)

**Cons:**
- Both lenses f/2 (1/3 stop slower than f/1.8)
- Third-party AF not quite Sony-level

---

### Strategy C: Mixed (Best Value + Performance) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Lenses:**
| Lens                   | Use Case                  | Price    | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Sony FE 35mm f/1.8     | Night city, indoor events | $750-850 | 280g   |
| Viltrox 85mm f/2.0 Evo | Kid portraits             | $350-400 | 298g   |

**Total:** ~$1,100-1,250 | 578g both primes

**Rationale:**
- 35mm used more often → invest in Sony for best AF speed
- 85mm for portrait sessions → Viltrox Evo has fast VCM AF
- **Best balance of cost, weight, and performance**
- Lightest complete kit (578g)

### Your Use Cases: How f/1.8 Helps

**Indoor Gala Night Scenario:**
| Setting         | f/4 Zoom          | f/1.8 Prime      | Advantage       |

**Night City Sightseeing:**
| Scenario     | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |

**🏛️ Museum Gallery (NEW):**
| Scenario                  | f/4 Zoom        | f/1.8 Prime     | Advantage       |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Bright gallery            | ISO 1600        | ISO 400         | Maximum detail  |
| Dim Old Masters room      | ISO 6400, 1/60s | ISO 1600, 1/60s | 2 stops cleaner |

**Museum-Specific Advantages of f/1.8:**
- **No flash required** - Most museums prohibit flash photography
- **Silent shooting** - A7C II electronic shutter + quiet prime AF
- **Compact gear** - Museums may restrict professional-looking equipment
- **Natural colors** - Avoid flash washing out artwork colors

**A7C II + f/1.8 = No-Flash Photography**

The A7C II has excellent high-ISO performance up to ISO 6400 with acceptable noise. Combined with:
- f/1.8 aperture (4× light vs f/4)
- 5-axis IBIS (3-4 stops)
- Fast eye-AF (works in -4EV)

You can shoot almost any indoor event or museum without flash, preserving natural ambiance.

## 📐 Why NOT Other Focal Lengths

### ❌ 20mm Prime
- **Your mobile (Samsung S25):** Already shoots 13mm ultra-wide excellently
- **Usage data:** Only 6-8% of shots at ultra-wide
- **Indoor events:** Too wide, distorts faces at edges
- **Verdict:** Mobile covers this; don't duplicate

### ❌ 24mm Prime
- **Too close to mobile:** S25 shoots 23mm - nearly identical
- **Not wide enough:** If you want wider than mobile, go 20mm
- **Indoor limitation:** Similar issues as 20mm for portraits
- **Verdict:** Redundant with your smartphone

### ❌ 40mm Prime
- **"Tweener" focal length:** Neither wide nor portrait
- **Limited options:** Fewer choices, often slower (f/2.5)
- **Your data:** No strong clustering at 40mm in archives
- **Verdict:** 35mm more versatile

### ❌ 50mm Prime
- **Too close to 35mm:** Only 15mm difference
- **Not enough for portraits:** 50mm less flattering than 85mm for faces
- **Your data:** 50mm usage lower than 35mm and 85mm peaks
- **Verdict:** Creates awkward coverage with 35mm or 85mm
